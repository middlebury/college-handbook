<p>This Title IX Formal Grievance Procedure (“Procedure”) applies to instances of Sexual Harassment (as defined by May 2020 U.S. Department of Education Title IX regulation) which occur on or after August 14, 2020.  All references to Sexual Harassment within this Procedure are intended to apply to and comply with the definition of Sexual Harassment as defined by Department of Education in its Title IX regulation.</p>
<p>Middlebury may, in exceptional circumstances, vary from this Procedure.  So long as such a variation is consistent with Title IX regulations and allows for fundamental fairness in the processes followed, variations from this process under those circumstances will not invalidate an outcome.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise specified herein, this Procedure applies to faculty, staff and students, as well as to others who participate or attempt to participate in Middlebury’s programs and activities.  This includes the undergraduate college, the Language Schools, the School of the Environment, MiddCore, Bread Loaf School of English, Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference, and the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey ("the Institute").<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>  Faculty and staff are, together, referred to as “Employee” or “Employees” in this Procedure.</p>
<p>This Procedure applies to Sexual Harassment as defined by the Department of Education and as set forth in the <a href="/handbook/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy" title="Non-discrimination">Non-Discrimination Policy</a> so long as the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(i) The alleged conduct was perpetrated against a person in the United States; and</p>
<p>(ii) The alleged conduct took place within Middlebury’s programs and activities, meaning that the conduct occurred in a location, at an event, or in a circumstance where Middlebury exercises substantial control over both the respondent and the context in which the conduct occurs, or in any building owned or controlled by a student organization recognized by Middlebury; <strong>and</strong>, the Complainant is participating in or attempting to participate in Middlebury’s programs or activities.</p>
<p>Conduct that occurs off campus in locations or at events without direction or control by Middlebury does not meet the definition of occurring in “a program or activity of Middlebury”.  Such conduct may be prohibited under other Middlebury policies, including the Non-Discrimination Policy provisions addressing forms of discrimination other than Title IX Sexual Harassment, and is addressed using different procedures.  Only behavior meeting the definitional requirements of this section will be addressed utilizing this Procedure.  Where a complaint alleges other Middlebury policy violations arising out of the same facts and circumstances as allegations that must be addressed utilizing this Procedure, Middlebury may, in its discretion, address those other alleged violations through this Procedure.</p>
<p>Conduct that occurred prior to August 14, 2020 will be investigated and adjudicated consistent with the procedures detailed in the <a href="/handbook/assets/smdvs-prior-to-8-14-2020.pdf" title="SMDVS">SMDVS Policy</a> and/or the <a href="/handbook/assets/anti-harassment-prior-to-8-14-2020.pdf" title="AHD">Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy</a> in effect during Academic Year 2019-2020, prior to the August 14, 2020 effective date of the Department of Education’s May 2020 regulations.  However, informal or “adaptable” resolutions may be available to address concerns about alleged conduct under the <a href="/handbook/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy" title="Non-discrimination">Non-Discrimination Policy</a> regardless of the date it occurred.</p>

<p><strong>In order to fulfill its commitment to fostering a safe and inclusive learning environment, Middlebury values reporting of all types of sexual harassment, which includes sexual assault.</strong> Any person who believes that they have been subject to Title IX Sexual Harassment, or who has reason to believe that Title IX Sexual Harassment has occurred or is occurring, should report this information to the immediate attention of the Civil Rights and Title IX (“CRTIX”) Coordinator.  The CRTIX Coordinator is:</p>

<p>A report or complaint may be made verbally (in person, by phone, or videoconferencing) during applicable business hours, or in writing (via mail or email) 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. You may also report using the online reporting tool at go/report. Please note that while a report may be made anonymously, this will limit Middlebury’s ability to take action to provide supportive measures or to address the situation.</p>
<p><strong>Which Middlebury Employees Must Report Sexual Harassment?</strong></p>
<p><strong>With the exception of certain persons designated as “Confidential Resources,” as described below, all Middlebury employees must report any incident that could constitute Sexual Harassment involving a Middlebury student, employee or other covered person, to the CRTIX Coordinator and/or an HRO</strong>.

To the extent possible, information reported will be shared with others only to the extent necessary to respond to the situation and support the parties and in accordance with state and federal law. Examples include individuals who are responsible for processing, investigating, adjudicating, and responding to sexual misconduct, domestic and dating violence and  misconduct, stalking and/or related retaliation reports; deans; program directors; supervisors; Human Resources staff; and Department of Public Safety or other campus security personnel who are responsible for reporting campus crime statistics and issuing timely warnings under the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act.</p>

<p>Confidential Resources include the staff of the Parton Cent(er for Health and Wellness, the staff of the Chaplain’s office, Middlebury Safe and Confidential Advocates (“MiddSafe”) <a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>) or other medical, counseling, support or religious personnel and volunteers who are required by law to maintain confidentiality.</p>
<p>Middlebury encourages individuals to use confidential services.  Individuals who seek those services should understand that confidentiality is not absolute and that those resources may have ethical or legal obligations to report certain information to others.  As one example, Confidential Resources are typically obligated under state law to report instances of child abuse.</p>

<p><em>Supportive measures</em> are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge to the complainant or the respondent before or after the filing of a formal complaint or where no formal complaint has been filed. Such measures are designed to restore or preserve equal access to the recipient’s education program or activity without unreasonably burdening the other party, including measures designed to protect the safety of all parties or the recipient’s educational environment, or deter sexual harassment. Supportive measures may include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>counseling;</li>
<li>academic accommodations, such as extensions of deadlines or other course-related adjustments, course changes or late drops, or other arrangements as appropriate (see the Academics: Course Registration and Conduct of Courses and Grades and Transcripts sections of the Handbook for more information);</li>
<li>modifications of work or class schedules;</li>
<li>campus escort services;</li>
<li>mutual restrictions on contact between the parties;</li>
<li>Residential accommodations, including but not limited to arranging for new housing, or providing temporary housing options, as appropriate;</li>
<li>changes in work locations;</li>
<li>leaves of absence;</li>
<li>increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus;</li>
<li>Changing transportation or working arrangements or providing other employment accommodations, as appropriate;</li>
<li>Assisting the individual in accessing support services, including, as available, victim advocacy, academic support, counseling, disability, health or mental health services, visa and immigration assistance, student financial aid services, and legal assistance both on and off campus, as applicable (see Appendix C for a list of resources);</li>
<li>No Trespass Notices prohibiting the presence of an individual on Middlebury property, and/or other properties on which Middlebury programs are occurring;</li>
<li>Informing the individual of the right to report a crime to local law enforcement and/or seek orders of protection, restraining orders, or relief from abuse orders from United States courts or courts outside of the United States as applicable, and providing assistance if the individual wishes to do so. Middlebury will also work with complainants and others as appropriate to respect and implement the requirements of such orders on premises that it owns or controls, as necessary and appropriate;</li>
<li>and other similar measures.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not necessary to file a complaint with Middlebury, participate in an adjudication process, or file a criminal complaint in order to request supportive measures from Middlebury.</p>
<p>Where a complainant reportedly subjected to Sexual Harassment makes a request for supportive measures like those described above, Middlebury will consider the request and provide those Supportive measures which are reasonably available and reasonably allow for the preservation or restoration of access to or participation in Middlebury programs.</p>
<p>Students or employees seeking supportive measures should direct their request to the CRTIX Coordinator, HROs, Human Resources, dean, or program director, as appropriate. The request will be evaluated and responded to by the CRTIX Coordinator or designee (e.g. HRO<del>s</del>, Student Life Dean, or program director) after consultation, as needed, with the appropriate authority or authorities for the school or program at issue. The CRTIX Coordinator is ultimately responsible for coordinating the effective implementation of supportive measures. Factors to be considered in determining whether to provide certain supportive measures may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the specific need expressed by the party;</li>
<li>the severity and/or pervasiveness of the allegations;</li>
<li>any continuing effects on the party;</li>
<li>whether the parties share the same residence hall, dining hall, class, extracurricular activities, transportation and/or job location;</li>
<li>whether other judicial measures have been taken to protect a party or the parties; and.</li>
<li>whether other measures are reasonably available to support the individual.</li>
</ul>
<p>Middlebury will maintain as confidential any supportive measures provided to a party, to the extent that maintaining such confidentiality would not impair the ability of Middlebury to provide the supportive measures. As such, Middlebury may need to disclose some information about the individual to a third party to provide the supportive measures in a timely manner. The following individuals are typically responsible for determining what information should be disclosed and to whom it should be disclosed: CRTIX Coordinator, an HRO, dean, Public Safety officer or program director. The decision to disclose information will be made after careful consideration of possible alternatives to disclosure and/or limiting the information provided to the third party as much as possible without compromising Middlebury’s ability to provide the supportive measures.</p>

<p>Where there is an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual arising from the alleged Title IX Sexual Harassment, Middlebury can remove a respondent from its education program or activity (which may include removing an employee respondent from their employment at Middlebury) and issue any necessary related no-trespass and no-contact orders.  Middlebury will make the decision to remove a respondent from its education program or activity based on an individualized assessment and risk analysis.

<p>Middlebury may place employee respondents (non-students) on paid administrative leave during the pendency of an investigation and resolution process as outlined below. Middlebury reserves the right to place an employee respondent (non-student) on unpaid administrative leave during the pendency of an investigation and resolution process. In those instances in which Middlebury determines that an administrative leave will be unpaid and the respondent was not offered the opportunity to challenge the suspension without pay before it was imposed through some other process, the respondent may present a written challenge regarding the need for or the adequacy of the unpaid administrative leave to the CRTIX Coordinator. Once a written challenge of unpaid administrative leave is received, the CRTIX Coordinator will involve the relevant Middlebury leadership, which may include Human Resources and/or department leaders, and schedule a virtual or in-person meeting with the respondent prior to making a determination.</p>

<p>1. Middlebury will investigate alleged Title IX Sexual Harassment where a complainant submits a signed or electronically submitted formal complaint to the CRTIX coordinator, requests an investigation, and the signed written complaint meets the requirements of this section. In cases where the complainant does not wish to submit a formal complaint but the CRTIX Coordinator decides in their discretion to sign a complaint and initiate an investigation and resolution process, the CRTIX Coordinator will not be a complainant or otherwise a party to the matter.  Middlebury will terminate the Title IX Sexual Harassment Investigation if a complainant notifies the CRTIX Coordinator in writing that the complainant would like to withdraw the formal complaint.</p>
<p>2. When a complainant requests an investigation,</p>
<p>(a) the CRTIX Coordinator will, promptly upon receipt of a report, determine whether:</p>
<p>i) the conduct alleged would, if proved, constitute Title IX Sexual Harassment (i.e., <em>Quid Pro Quo</em> Sexual Harassment, Severe, Pervasive and Objectively Offensive Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, or sex-based Domestic Violence, Dating Violence or Stalking) as defined in the Non-Discrimination Policy as Title IX Sexual Harassment;</p>
<p>ii) the conduct allegedly occurred in Middlebury’s education program or activity; and</p>
<p>iii)  the conduct allegedly occurred in the United States.</p>
<p>(b) the CRTIX Coordinator/HRO or designee may gather additional information as appropriate before making the determinations required by part (a) of this subsection. During any such initial inquiry, all individuals are expected to cooperate.</p>
<p>3. If some but not all of the conduct alleged in the complaint satisfies all 3 of these elements and a formal complaint is received from a complainant or signed by the CRTIX Coordinator, Middlebury may choose to address the entire matter through this Title IX Sexual Harassment Procedure (that is, it will as required by federal regulations follow Title IX Sexual Harassment procedures to address the alleged Title IX Sexual Harassment, and it may, to promote efficiency or for other compelling reasons, choose to follow this Title IX Sexual Harassment Procedure to address other prohibited conduct in such mixed cases, so that all related misconduct may be addressed through one investigation and resolution process).</p>
<p>4. If it appears based upon initial review or upon information gathered during an investigation that the matter does not satisfy and/or no longer satisfies all 3 of these elements, Middlebury will, as required by Title IX regulations, dismiss the matter from the Title IX Sexual Harassment Procedure, and will transfer it for handling under the Non-Discrimination Investigation and Resolutions Procedure or other Middlebury procedures, as deemed appropriate by Middlebury.</p>
<p>5. Even if the allegations of a matter fall within the definition of Title IX Sexual Harassment, Middlebury may (but is not required to) dismiss a formal complaint or any allegations therein if at any time during the investigation or resolution process:</p>
<ul>
<li>A complainant notifies the Title IX Coordinator in writing that the complainant would like to withdraw the formal complaint or any allegations therein;</li>
<li>The respondent is no longer enrolled or employed by Middlebury; or</li>
<li>Specific circumstances prevent Middlebury from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination as to the formal complaint or allegations therein.</li>
</ul>
<p>6. If a formal complaint is dismissed by Middlebury under the circumstances described above, Middlebury will simultaneously provide to the parties written notice (by electronic or other means) of the dismissal and the reasons for the dismissal, and notice of the parties’ opportunity to appeal such dismissal through the Title IX Sexual Harassment appeal procedures outlined below.</p>
<p>7. If the respondent is a Student and an Employee, the CRTIX Coordinator will determine which procedures apply based upon the facts and circumstances, such as whether the respondent’s status as a Student or an Employee predominates in the context of the Prohibited Conduct. If a Student-Employee is found to have engaged in Prohibited Conduct, the Student-Employee may be subject to sanctions both in connection with their employment and in connection with their student status, as appropriate under these and other applicable procedures.</p>

If the CRTIX Coordinator/HRO becomes aware, at any point prior to or during the investigation and adjudication process, of additional allegations against the respondent that, if proven, could constitute violations of other non-academic policies, including harassment or discrimination investigated under Middlebury’s Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy, these allegations may, at Middlebury’s discretion, be investigated and adjudicated in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.  In matters involving Employees, where the CRTIX Coordinator/HRO becomes aware of additional allegations of violations of Middlebury Policy, those concerns will be reported to the Employee’s appropriate supervisory authority (e.g., VPAA/dean of the Faculty, VPAA/dean of the Institute, VPAA/dean of the Language Schools, Executive Vice President/Provost), who, in consultation with Human Resources,  will consider whether and how to proceed under the relevant Faculty Handbook or Employee Handbook procedures and/or applicable contracts or policies.</p>
<p>2. If one party alleges that another party violated a No Contact Order (NCO) or No Trespass Notice (NTN) and makes the allegations at a time when they can be evaluated during an ongoing Title IX Sexual Harassment investigation/adjudication or after the Title IX Sexual Harassment investigation/adjudication process has been completed, the HRO or HRO’s designee will determine how to proceed.</p>
<p>3. If the HRO does not assume jurisdiction, the allegations may be addressed through Middlebury's conduct process for the appropriate school or program, or through the appropriate employment process. Alternatively, the HRO may designate an appropriate Middlebury official(s) to oversee and/or conduct an investigation and adjudicate the matter.  If a violation of a NCO or NTN is found, the matter will be referred to the appropriate supervisory authority for discipline and/or other appropriate action in accordance with existing handbook policies.</p>
<p>4. If the HRO assumes jurisdiction over the allegations and deems an investigation to be necessary, the HRO will determine the scope, process, and timeline of the NCO/NTN investigation and adjudication, which may not necessarily follow the procedures outlined in this Title IX Investigation &#x26; Resolutions Procedure, if the HRO determines that using other procedures is more appropriate. The HRO has the discretion to determine whether an advisor of choice may be present at any processes or meetings related to an NCO/NTN investigation, depending on the circumstances. Both parties will have an opportunity to review and respond to all evidence relevant to the NCO/NTN investigation according to a timeline established by the HRO. The HRO will make a finding and will refer the matter to the appropriate sanctioning authority if a violation is found. Should the HRO determine that an NCO/NTN violation may also constitute retaliation, the parties will be notified in writing that retaliation will be added to the policies under consideration in the Title IX Sexual Harassment investigation or be part of a subsequent investigation, as applicable.</p>
<p>5. In all cases the parties will receive written notification if the CRTIX Coordinator/HRO determines that additional possible policy violations will be investigated and adjudicated in accordance with the Title IX procedures set forth herein or through a different set of procedures.</p>

<p>If either party is concerned that an official involved in the investigation or adjudication (such as, for example, an investigator, CRTIX Coordinator, or HRO) may be biased or have a conflict of interest, the party should share their concerns immediately. Concerns of this nature about the investigator should be shared with the CRTIX Coordinator; concerns about the CRTIX Coordinator or an HRO should be shared with the Chief Diversity Officer. The official with whom the concern is shared will consider the concern and inform the parties of a decision as to whether any related action is appropriate and whether an alternate will be appointed. If an alternate investigator, HRO, or CRTIX Coordinator is appointed, the alternate shall have the same authority as the originally designated official.</p>

<ol>
<li>General Investigation Provisions</li>
</ol>
<p>As required by the 2020 Title IX regulations, in investigations conducted under this Procedure, the following provisions will apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>The burden of proof and the burden of gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination regarding responsibility rest on Middlebury and not on the parties;</li>
<li>Parties will have an equal opportunity to present witnesses, including fact and expert witnesses, and other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence;</li>
<li>Parties are not restricted in their ability to discuss the allegations under investigation or to gather and present relevant evidence; and</li>
<li>When a party is invited or expected to attend a hearing, investigative interview, or other meeting, they will receive written notice of the date, time location, participants, and purpose of such a hearing, investigative interview or meeting, with sufficient time for the party to prepare to participate.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Initial Notice of Investigation</li>
</ol>
<p>When Middlebury initiates an investigation under this Procedure it will provide to the parties a written notice (by electronic or other means) that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about Middlebury’s formal and informal resolution processes;</li>
<li>A statement of the allegations of behavior potentially constituting Title IX Sexual Harassment, including sufficient details known at the time and with sufficient time to prepare a response before any initial post-intake interview. Sufficient details include the identities of the parties involved in the incident, if known, the conduct allegedly constituting Title IX Sexual Harassment, and the date and location of the alleged incident, if known;</li>
<li>A statement that the respondent is presumed not responsible for the alleged conduct and that a determination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the grievance process;</li>
<li>Information regarding Middlebury’s presumption of good faith reporting and a summary of false complaint information outlined below;</li>
<li>Notification that the parties may have an advisor of their choice, who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney; and</li>
<li>Notification that the parties may inspect and review evidence during the investigation and resolution process, as provided below.</li>
</ul>
<p>If, in the course of an investigation, Middlebury decides to investigate allegations about any party that are not included in the notice described above, it will provide notice of the additional allegations to the parties whose identities are known.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Consolidation of Formal Complaints</li>
</ol>
<p>Middlebury may consolidate formal complaints of Title IX Sexual Harassment against more than one respondent, or by more than one complainant against one or more respondents, or by one party against the other party, where the allegations of such Title IX Sexual Harassment arise out of the same facts or circumstances. Where a grievance process involves more than one complainant or more than one respondent, references in this section to the singular “party,” “complainant,” or “respondent” include the plural, as applicable.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Disabilities</li>
</ol>
<p>Students registered with the <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/studentlife/doc/ada">Disability Resource Center </a>can request accommodations to ensure their full and equal participation in any conduct process and/or proceeding. Accommodation requests may be made directly to the CRTIX Coordinator. Accommodations are determined on an individual basis in consultation with the ADA Coordinators. Employees with disabilities may contact Human Resources.</p>

<ol>
<li>The CRTIX Coordinator will appoint an investigator. In selecting the investigator for a particular matter, the CRTIX Coordinator will take care to select an individual who does not have a conflict of interest or bias against complainants or respondents generally or an individual complainant or respondent. The CRTIX Coordinator will notify the parties of the identity of the investigator and parties may, within three calendar days of such notice, object to the appointment of the investigator by providing a written statement (which may be transmitted electronically) as to why the party believes that the investigator has a conflict of interest or bias. The CRTIX Coordinator will make decisions regarding such objections and the appointment of an alternate investigator, as necessary.</li>
<li>The investigator is authorized to contact any and all individuals who may have relevant information. The nature and scope of the investigation is within the discretion of the investigator.  The investigator is authorized to access relevant records, except those legally protected as confidential or privileged, and may collect any additional evidence relevant to the complaint. Middlebury recognizes, however, that individuals who are bound by legal privileges may not be able to disclose privileged information, unless an exception applies. The investigator will not access, consider, disclose or otherwise use a party’s privileged records without the party’s voluntary, written consent to do so, and such information will not be deemed relevant to an investigation or adjudication absent the voluntary, written consent of the party.</li>
<li>The complainant and respondent will be asked to identify, preserve and submit all evidence pertaining to the matter under investigation, and to identify witnesses they believe may have relevant testimony to share. The investigator is not required to consider particular evidence submitted or interview any particular witness, even if identified by one of the parties.</li>
<li>All participants in the investigation are expected to provide complete, accurate, and truthful information.</li>

<ol>
<li>After the complainant and the respondent have had the opportunity to make their own statement and to identify witnesses and other potential information, and the investigator has completed witness interviews and the gathering of evidence, the investigator will prepare a preliminary report.</li>
<li>Middlebury will provide each party with an equal opportunity to inspect and review any evidence obtained as part of the investigation that is directly related to the allegations raised, including the evidence upon which Middlebury does not intend to rely in reaching a determination regarding responsibility and/or which the investigator does not deem relevant, and inculpatory or exculpatory evidence whether obtained from a party or other source, so that each party can meaningfully respond to the evidence prior to conclusion of the investigation. Such evidence will not include privileged records or information that may have been gathered or received during the investigation, absent written consent from the party holding the privilege.</li>
<li>Middlebury will send to each party and the party’s advisor, if any, the evidence subject to inspection and review in an electronic format or a hard copy.</li>
<li>Parties and advisors are not permitted to download, print or copy such evidence subject to inspection and review, and are not permitted to re-disclose such evidence without Middlebury’s permission. Parties and advisors will be required to sign an acknowledgment form indicating that they understand these prohibitions. Violations of these prohibitions may subject parties to Middlebury discipline under applicable conduct codes.</li>
<li>The complainant and the respondent will have an opportunity to review the preliminary report within the same time period and provide written responses to the report.  The complainant and the respondent must submit any comments, feedback, additional documents, evidence, suggested questions for individuals interviewed, requests for additional investigation, names of additional witnesses, or any other information they deem relevant to the investigator, including additional documents or other evidence, within 10 calendar days after the preliminary report is sent to them for review.  The parties' written responses will be considered by the investigator prior to completion of the final investigative report, and some or all of the responses may be attached or otherwise incorporated into the final investigative report.</li>
<li>In the event that new, relevant information is provided or identified at this stage, the information will be incorporated into the preliminary report as deemed appropriate by the investigator, and the complainant and the respondent will be provided a second opportunity  to review and provide a written response regarding the new information, which the investigator will consider prior to completion of the final investigation report.  Identification of new and relevant information after the parties’ review of the preliminary report is likely to extend the time frame of the investigation.</li>

<li>The final investigative report created by the investigator will fairly summarize relevant evidence and include as exhibits evidentiary materials as deemed appropriate by the investigator;</li>

The hearing officer has broad authority to determine the process, timing and conduct of a hearing. For example, the hearing officer will determine the order of presentation, timing and overall duration of the hearing, what information and evidence will be heard, what information and questions are relevant to the determination of the matter, and what cross-examination questions will or will not be permitted.</p>
<p>Hearing officers, ordinarily one of Middlebury’s HROs, will be appointed by the CRTIX Coordinator. In selecting a hearing officer for a particular matter, the CRTIX Coordinator will take care to select an individual who does not have a conflict of interest or bias against complainants or respondents generally or an individual complainant or respondent. Middlebury will notify the parties of the identity of the hearing officer in advance of the hearing, and parties may, within 3 calendar days of such notice, object to the service of the hearing officer by providing a written statement (which may be transmitted electronically) as to why the party believes that the hearing officer has a conflict of interest or bias. The CRTIX Coordinator or designee will make decisions regarding such objections and the appointment of an alternate hearing officer, as necessary.</p>

<p>Each party may have an advisor of their choice present at a hearing for the limited purpose of conducting cross-examination on behalf of that party. Advisors are not required to be attorneys, but attorneys are permitted to serve as advisors. If a party does not have an advisor of their choice present at a hearing, Middlebury will without fee or charge to the party provide an advisor of Middlebury’s choice, for the limited purpose of conducting cross-examination on behalf of that party. No later than 10 calendar days before the hearing, parties should inform the CRTIX Coordinator of the identity of any advisor of choice who will accompany them to the hearing, so that Middlebury will know whether or not it needs to arrange for the presence of a Middlebury-provided advisor, even if the party declines to attend the hearing.</p>
<p>At a time and manner deemed appropriate by the hearing officer, the advisor for each party will be permitted to ask the other party and any witnesses all relevant cross-examination questions and follow-up questions, including those challenging credibility. Advisors must comply with the conduct expectations for hearings. Except for the limited role of asking cross-examination questions, advisors may not participate actively in the hearing and may not speak or otherwise communicate on the part of the party that the advisor is advising. However, the advisor may consult privately in a non-disruptive manner with their advisee during and/or at a recess in the hearing. Scheduling accommodations generally will not be made for advisors if they unduly delay the process. Middlebury reserves the right to take appropriate action regarding any advisor who disrupts the process, or who does not abide by the restrictions on their participation as determined in the sole discretion of the hearing officer, which may include exclusion of the advisor from the hearing and the appointment of an alternate Middlebury-provided advisor.</p>

<p>A Middlebury faculty or staff member who agrees to serve as an advisor to a complainant or respondent is not an agent of Middlebury when acting in that capacity and does not speak or act on Middlebury’s behalf while serving as an advisor.  The relationship between a party and their advisor for the TIX Sexual Harassment hearing is not confidential (or privileged), and the faculty or staff member’s duties to Middlebury—including all reporting obligations—remain intact.  Before agreeing to serve as an advisor, faculty and staff members should evaluate whether any conflict or potential conflict of interest may warrant their declining the invitation to serve as an advisor. In addition, only licensed attorneys can provide legal advice. Parties seeking legal advice should consult their attorney.</p>

<p>If a Party wishes to have an individual appear at the hearing as a witness, they must provide notice of the identity of the proposed witness and a brief description of the subject matter of the witnesses’ testimony to the CRTIX Coordinator or designee at least 10 calendar days before the date of the hearing. The CRTIX Coordinator or designee, in consultation with the hearing officer as necessary, will determine whether the witness is likely to have information that is relevant to the hearing, and if it is determined that the witness is likely to have relevant information, the CRTIX Coordinator or designee will inform the witness that their presence at the hearing is expected. These provisions apply equally to both fact and expert witnesses.</p>

<p><strong>A) Report to be provided to Hearing Officer</strong></p>
<p>At or before the hearing, the hearing officer will receive a copy of the investigative report, any attachments thereto, and copies of the parties’ written responses to the investigative report, if any, which will be part of the information of record to be considered by the hearing officer to the extent appropriate in light of the rules regarding evidence to be considered that are outlined below.</p>
<p><strong>B) General Order of the Hearing</strong></p>
<p>(i) Subject to the discretion of the hearing officer, hearings will ordinarily begin with introductory remarks by the hearing officer to explain the process, followed by a brief opening statement from any party who wishes to provide one, followed by the hearing officer’s asking relevant initial questions of the parties as deemed appropriate by the hearing officer. During this portion of the hearing, advisors may confer privately and in a non-disruptive manner with their advisee, but they are not allowed to make opening statements or otherwise address the hearing officer or anyone else present at the hearing.</p>
<p>(ii) After the hearing officer has asked their initial questions of the parties, the hearing officer will permit each party’s advisor to ask the other party all relevant questions and follow-up questions, including those challenging credibility. Subject to the discretion of the hearing officer, questioning of witnesses will generally follow a similar process, whereby the hearing officer will pose relevant questions to each witness, then the parties’ advisors will be permitted to ask relevant questions of witnesses. In accordance with the 2020 Title IX regulations, such cross-examination by advisors will be conducted orally, and in real time by the party’s advisor of choice and never by a party personally.</p>
<p>(iii) Only relevant cross-examination and other questions may be asked of a party or witness. Before a complainant, respondent, or witness answers a cross-examination or other question, the hearing officer will first determine whether the question is relevant and explain any decision to exclude a question as not relevant. Advisors are not permitted to object to hearing officer decisions regarding relevance during a hearing.</p>
<p>(iv) The evidence gathered throughout the investigation will be made available at the hearing, and each party and/or their advisor (as applicable) will have an equal opportunity to refer to such evidence during the hearing, including for purposes of cross-examination.</p>
<p>(v) At the discretion of the hearing officer, parties (but not their advisors) will usually be given an opportunity to make a closing statement at the conclusion of the hearing.</p>
<p><strong>C) Evidence</strong></p>
<p>(i) Questions and evidence about the complainant’s sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant and will not be permitted, except for the limited circumstance where such questions and evidence about the complainant’s prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the respondent committed the conduct alleged by the complainant, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the complainant’s prior sexual behavior with respect to the respondent and are offered to prove consent.</p>
<p>(ii) Information protected under a legally recognized privilege (such as, for example, privileged communications between a party and their physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in a treatment capacity, or privileged communications between a party and their attorney), are not relevant unless the person holding the privilege has waived the privilege in writing and the hearing officer determines it is relevant.</p>
<p>(iii) If a party or witness does not submit to cross-examination at the live hearing, the hearing officer will only consider any statement of that party or witness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility to the extent permitted by the law, Title IX regulations and/or U.S. Department of Education guidance that apply or applies as of the time of the hearing. The hearing officer will not draw an inference about the determination regarding responsibility based solely on a party’s or witness’s absence from the live hearing or refusal to answer cross-examination or other questions.</p>

<p>Within a reasonable time, the hearing officer (and if necessary the sanctioning authority, as provided below) will prepare and issue a written determination regarding responsibility and a recommendation on sanctions. In determining responsibility, the hearing officer will apply the preponderance of the evidence standard. The written determination will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identification of the section(s) of Middlebury’s Non-Discrimination Policy alleged to have been violated</li>
<li>A description of the procedural steps taken from the receipt of the complaint through the determination, including but not limited to, as applicable, any notifications to the parties, interviews with parties and witnesses, site visits, methods used to gather other evidence, and hearings held</li>
<li>Findings of fact supporting the determination</li>
<li>Conclusions regarding the application of definitions of Title IX Sexual Harassment in Middlebury’s Non-Discrimination Policy to the facts;</li>
<li>A statement of, and rationale for, the result as to each allegation, including a determination regarding responsibility; and</li>
<li>Identification of Middlebury’s procedures and permissible bases for the Complainant and Respondent to appeal (as outlined below).</li>
</ul>
<p>The determination regarding responsibility becomes final either on the date that Middlebury provides the parties with the written determination of the appeal, if an appeal is filed, or if an appeal is not filed, the date on which the appeal would no longer be considered timely.</p>
<p>If sanctions are necessary, they will be assigned in accordance with the Sanctions section below. The parties will receive notice simultaneously of the written determination and, if necessary, any sanctions as determined through the procedures outlined below.</p>

<p>1. If the hearing officer finds that the respondent engaged in behavior that violates Middlebury policy, the CRTIX Coordinator will, in accordance with this Procedure, forward the case to the appropriate supervisory authority for the program at issue (“sanctioning authority”), who will assign a sanction or sanctions, and other actions as appropriate. The hearing officer and the sanctioning authority will collaborate on the creation of a single written determination that will include the hearing officer’s statement and rationale regarding responsibility as described in more detail above, a statement of and rationale for any disciplinary action Middlebury is imposing on the respondent, and whether remedies designed to restore or preserve equal access to the educational program or activity of Middlebury will be provided by Middlebury to the complainant.</p>
<p>In determining the sanction or sanctions and/or other actions, the sanctioning authority will be guided by a number of considerations, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The severity, pervasiveness and/or objective offensiveness of the behavior;</li>
<li>The nature of the Title IX Sexual Harassment;</li>
<li>The impact of the Title IX Sexual Harassment on the complainant;</li>
<li>The impact or implications of the Title IX Sexual Harassment within the Middlebury community;</li>
<li>Any prior misconduct by the respondent, including the respondent’s relevant prior conduct history, at Middlebury or elsewhere;</li>
<li>Whether the respondent has accepted responsibility for the Title IX Sexual Harassment;</li>
<li>The maintenance of a safe, nondiscriminatory and respectful environment conducive to living, learning, and/or working, as applicable; and</li>
<li>Any other mitigating, aggravating, or compelling factors.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a student respondent is found responsible for sexual assault, suspension or expulsion are the likely outcomes.</p>
<p>2. Sanctions and other actions will go into effect at either the expiration of the deadline for the submission of an appeal where no appeal is submitted, or at the conclusion of the appeal process if applicable. This language does not preclude the possibility of emergency action as needed; please see Section II.D, Emergency Removals and Non-Student Administrative Leave.</p>
<p>3. If the hearing officer finds conduct that violates the Non-Discrimination Policy (or other Middlebury policies under investigation), the CRTIX Coordinator will provide the case materials to the appropriate supervisory authority or authorities (e.g., for students: the Vice President for Student Affairs at the College,  the Dean of the Language Schools, the Dean of Enrollment, Advising and Student Services at the Institute, the Dean of the Bread Loaf School of English, etc.; for staff, that staff member’s supervisor, and for faculty, the Provost). When multiple supervisory authorities are involved in assigning sanctions, they may collaborate with each other as appropriate.</p>
<p>After a review of the case materials and the hearing officer’s recommendation regarding sanctions, the supervisory authority may impose disciplinary sanctions.  Sanctioning and appeals for faculty whose primary appointment is in the undergraduate college will follow the procedures for Middlebury College faculty, regardless of the program for which the individual was employed at the time of the incident.</p>
<p>Sanctions for Prohibited Conduct could include written reprimands, probationary status, letters of official discipline, and/or suspension, expulsion, reassignment of duties, referral to other disciplinary processes, or termination from employment from any or all Middlebury program(s). Students should note that although sanctions for violation(s) of this policy can include any form of discipline as stated in this section, those found to have committed sexual assault will most likely receive a sanction of suspension or expulsion.  Middlebury may also take other non-disciplinary action as deemed appropriate under the circumstances (e.g., remedies applied to the respondent to address the needs of the complainant, including but not limited to room changes, class changes, building restrictions, extracurricular activity restrictions, modification of No Contact Orders to favor the complainant, and other actions designed to restore or preserve the complainant’s equal access to Middlebury’s educational program or activity). Middlebury may also provide notice of the matter to the appropriate supervisory authority of any Middlebury program in which the respondent intends to participate, who may consider this information in determining the respondent's admission to the program and/or other program participation parameters, as appropriate. Notification of a finding of responsibility, sanction, or other action under this policy may also be provided to the home institution of non-Middlebury undergraduate and graduate students or any other program in which the student is enrolled or to which the student is pursuing enrollment.</p>
<p>4. If the hearing officer finds that a <strong>faculty member</strong> has engaged in conduct that violates this policy, or other Middlebury policies under investigation, if applicable (absent or following an appeal of that finding in accordance with paragraph G3, above, if an appeal was granted), the CRTIX Coordinator and/or HRO will provide the case materials to the appropriate supervisory authority for the program at issue (e.g., the Middlebury College VPAA/Dean of Faculty, VPAA/Dean of the Institute, Vice President of the Language Schools, Dean of International Programs or Executive Vice President/Provost). The supervisory authority will refer the matter for separate procedures that may result in the imposition of appropriate disciplinary action according to the procedures in existing Faculty Handbook policies and/or contracts, as applicable. Disciplinary sanctions under this policy may therefore include written reprimands, salary freeze, termination of employment, reassignment or restriction of duties, and/or referral to separate procedures that govern employment status issues.</p>
<p>5. In any case in which a finding of sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking or related retaliation has been issued, violation of a plan or directive to address the prohibited conduct or related sanction may be grounds for further discipline.</p>

<li>The CRTIX Coordinator, investigator(s), or decision-maker(s) had a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally, or the individual complainant or respondent, that affected the outcome of the matter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of which party appeals, both parties may participate in the appeals process. Middlebury will provide written notification to the complainant and the respondent of any applicable appeal procedures at the time they receive the written determination regarding responsibility and any sanctions.</p>
<p>An appeal must be made in writing to the appropriate appellate officer, which are:</p>
<p>1. Students:</p>
<p>a. Undergraduate College students (including non-Middlebury students enrolled in Middlebury summer undergraduate courses): <strong>VPAA/Dean of Faculty or designee</strong></p>
<p>b. Middlebury Institute students: <strong>VPAA/Dean of the Institute or designee</strong></p>
<p>c. All other students in any other program:  <strong>Executive Vice President/Provost or designee</strong></p>
<p>2. Staff: <strong>VP of HR</strong><br>
3. Faculty: <strong>Executive Vice President/Provost or designee</strong></p>
<p>An appeal must articulate one of the three bases above and provide information to support the appealing party’s argument. Appeals must be filed no later than 5 business days after the date on which Middlebury transmitted the hearing officer’s written determination to the parties. The CRTIX Coordinator or appellate officer may extend this deadline if warranted by the circumstances. Middlebury reserves the right to assign an alternate appellate officer to avoid a conflict of interest or bias.  The appellate officer will not be the same person as the hearing officer, the investigator, the CRTIX Coordinator, or a person who made a decision to dismiss a formal complaint.</p>
<p>Middlebury will notify the other party in writing when an appeal is filed and implement appeal procedures equally for both parties. The other party may then have a period of 5 business days to submit a statement in support of the written determination and/or in opposition to the appeal. Any such statement will be shared with the party who filed the appeal and their advisor.</p>
<p>The appellate officer will issue a written decision describing the result of the appeal and the rationale for the result; and Middlebury will provide the written decision simultaneously to both parties. The appellate officer’s decision on any appeal is the final step in the adjudication process, unless the appellate officer provides otherwise as discussed below.</p>
<p>The appellate officer may uphold the determination by the sanctioning authority, or modify the determination by the sanctioning authority or return the case to the original hearing officer (or an alternate, if warranted) in the event that the appellate officer concludes that either (1) a procedural irregularity affected the outcome of the matter;  (2) new evidence that could affect the outcome, and which was not available at the time of the determination, has become available; or (3) a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally or the individual complainant or respondent that affected the outcome of the matter.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the appellate officer to determine which if any aspects of the case merit a new review, and to direct the CRTIX Coordinator accordingly.</p>
<p>Absent extenuating circumstances, the appellate officer will notify the complainant and respondent of the appeal decision simultaneously in writing within twenty business days of the appeal receipt deadline and will notify the CRTIX Coordinator in writing of any instructions for further action. This deadline may be extended if warranted by the circumstances. If this deadline is extended, the parties will be notified in writing at the time the extension is determined.</p>
<p>The decision to uphold or modify the determination by the appellate officer is final. If a case is returned for an additional hearing, the subsequent determination and/or sanction from that hearing are ordinarily final.</p>
<p><strong>Pending Discipline (Students)</strong></p>
<p>A student respondent will not be permitted to graduate from or otherwise be deemed to have officially completed a program in which they are enrolled while a disciplinary matter is pending; the student’s graduation or certification will be held in abeyance until the matter is resolved. If a respondent withdraws with a disciplinary matter, sanction, or appeal pending, the withdrawal will be considered a resignation from Middlebury, and the student will have given up the opportunity to return to Middlebury. The student’s official status at Middlebury will reflect the point in the process at which they withdrew, and the nature of the finding and sanction, as appropriate. Examples include but are not limited to "Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Matter Pending," "Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Sanction Pending," and "Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Appeal Pending."</p>
<p>In extraordinary circumstances, the appropriate supervisory authority may, after appropriate consultation, a review of the case, and consideration of Middlebury’s best interests, grant permission for a respondent to withdraw from Middlebury when a disciplinary matter is pending. If the student is readmitted to Middlebury, the disciplinary matter must be resolved either before the student's return, or immediately upon the student's return (as determined by Middlebury).</p>

<p>If at any point a respondent chooses to accept responsibility for violating all policies under investigation, an official designated by the CRTIX Coordinator will issue a determination and refer the matter to the appropriate supervisory authority or authorities for the program at issue in accordance with this Procedure. The appropriate supervisory authority or authorities will issue a sanction and/or take other action that is designed to restore or preserve the complainant’s equal access to Middlebury’s education program or activity.</p>

<p>Informal resolution is a voluntary option that does not involve a hearing process. Informal resolution may be used in Title IX Sexual Harassment matters in which a formal complaint has been filed by a complainant or signed by the CRTIX Coordinator.</p>
<p>The CRTIX Coordinator will assess the request for informal resolution in light of factors such as, but not limited to, the severity of the alleged violation and the potential risks to campus community members posed by the reported misconduct. Middlebury will only proceed with an informal resolution process if both parties provide their voluntary, written consent to initiate the informal resolution process. Middlebury will not offer or facilitate an informal resolution process in matters that involve allegations that an employee committed Title IX Sexual Harassment against a student.</p>
<p>At any time prior to reaching a determination regarding responsibility, Middlebury may facilitate an informal resolution process (e.g., mediation or restorative justice) where requested by one party and agreed to by the other party. If a party requests the initiation of an informal resolution process and the CRTIX Coordinator agrees that the matter is appropriate for informal resolution, Middlebury will provide to each party a written notice that discloses:</p>
<ul>
<li>The allegations;</li>
<li>The requirements of the informal resolution process, including the circumstances under which it precludes the parties from resuming a formal complaint arising from the same allegations-</li>
<li>As noted below, Middlebury generally permits parties to withdraw from the informal resolution process and initiate or re-initiate a formal investigation and hearing process at any time before the informal resolution process is completed and any informal resolution is agreed to in writing by the parties); and</li>
<li>Any consequences resulting from participating in the informal resolution process, including the records that will be maintained or could be shared.</li>
</ul>
<p>The matter will be deemed resolved if and when the parties expressly agree in writing to an outcome that is acceptable to them and which is approved by the CRTIX Coordinator (in consultation with other Middlebury administrators as deemed necessary).  A party may withdraw from the informal resolution process at any time prior to their execution of a written informal resolution agreement. After an informal resolution is agreed to in writing between the parties, neither party may initiate a formal resolution process regarding substantially the same factual allegations.</p>
<p>At any time before a matter is resolved through informal resolution, the CRTIX Coordinator may terminate an informal resolution process and initiate or re-initiate a formal investigation and hearing process at any time, as they deem appropriate in their discretion.</p>

<p>The CRTIX Coordinator, investigators, decision-makers, sanctioning authorities, appellate authorities, and individuals facilitating informal resolution processes (collectively, “Middlebury Officials”) receive training on the definition of Title IX Sexual Harassment in this policy, the scope of Middlebury’s education programs or activities, how to serve impartially (including by avoiding prejudgment of the facts at issue, conflicts of interest, and bias), and on issues of relevance of evidence as well as questions, including when questions and evidence about the complainant’s sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant. Any materials used to train Middlebury Officials will not rely on sex stereotypes and will promote impartial adjudications of formal complaints. Middlebury will ensure that all Middlebury Officials comply with the standards on serving impartially that are outlined in this paragraph.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Complainant</strong></p>
<p>A complainant is an individual who is reported to have experienced conduct that could constitute Prohibited Conduct, regardless of whether the individual makes a report or seeks disciplinary action</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Respondent</strong></p>
<p>A respondent is an individual who has been reported to have engaged in conduct that could constitute Prohibited Conduct and whose alleged conduct is being investigated to determine if it is in violation of Middlebury’s policies.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Report</strong></p>
<p>A Report is any information received by Middlebury College that a complainant has allegedly been subjected to conduct  which could constitute Title IX Sexual Harassment.  A Report is not a Formal Complaint and does not trigger a formal investigation or adjudication. Instead, reports serve as a basis for statistical reporting under the Jeanne Clery Act, and allow Middlebury to provide Supportive Measures to those who have experienced Title IX Sexual Harassment. Any Complainant who reports Title IX Sexual Harassment will receive information about the Formal Complaint and Investigation Process.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Formal Complaint</strong></p>
<p>Formal complaint means a document filed by a complainant or signed by the Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator alleging Title IX Sexual Harassment against a respondent and requesting that the recipient investigate the allegation of Title IX Sexual Harassment. At the time of filing a formal complaint, a complainant must be participating in or attempting to participate in the education program or activity of the recipient with which the formal complaint is filed. A formal complaint may be filed with the Title IX Coordinator in person, by mail, or by electronic mail, by using the contact information required to be listed for the Title IX Coordinator under § 106.8(a), and by any additional method designated by the recipient.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Human Relations Officer</strong></p>
<p>A Human Relations Officer (“HRO”) is an administrator responsible for overseeing investigations and adjudicating complaints under this Procedure. HROs are also the Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator’s designees responsible for overseeing investigations and adjudicating sexual misconduct complaints in accordance with this Procedure.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator</strong></p>
<p>The Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator ("CRTIX Coordinator") is the administrator designated and authorized to coordinate Middlebury’s efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under Title IX. The CRTIX Coordinator’s responsibilities include overseeing the process for handling and responding to all complaints of possible sex discrimination and identifying and addressing any patterns or systemic problems that arise during the review of such complaints.</p>
<p>Middlebury’s CRTIX Coordinator also participates in Middlebury’s handling and responding to complaints of sexual misconduct, domestic and dating violence and misconduct, and stalking, as defined in this policy.</p>
<p>References throughout this Procedure to the CRTIX should be read as including individuals to whom the CRTIX has designated certain duties either in general or in the context of a particular case or situation.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Days</strong></p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, “days” indicates calendar days, regardless of whether the majority of Middlebury’s administrative offices are open. “Business days” indicates days on which the majority of Middlebury’s administrative offices are open, and generally connotes Mondays through Fridays. In computing any period of time referenced in this Procedure, the day of the act or event (e.g., provision of evidence for review and response, issuance of a determination or sanction) from which the designated time period begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included if it is a business day; when not a business day, the period will conclude at the end of the next business day.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> <strong>Parties</strong></p>
<p>Only the complainant and respondent are considered a “party” or “parties” as that term is used within this policy.</p>
