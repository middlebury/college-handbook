title: B.2 Language Pledge

The Language Pledge is a firm commitment by students to use the language of study as their only language of communication during the summer session. It is the foundation of the residential immersion model of the Language Schools, designed to improve students' language proficiency as rapidly as possible across the skills – reading, writing, listening, and speaking. We expect all students to keep the Language Pledge, even on their own time. For violations of the Language Pledge that impact the learning of others in the community, students will be given written warnings. When repeated and documented violations threaten to disrupt the community, the student will be referred to the Dean's office for disciplinary action up to and including possible expulsion. 

Students are not expected to speak in their language of study when they are faced with an emergency, when conversing with a member of the Middlebury administration, when speaking with a healthcare professional, and on those occasions when it is absolutely necessary to use English or another language.
