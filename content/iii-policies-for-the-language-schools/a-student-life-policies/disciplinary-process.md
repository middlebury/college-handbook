title: Language Schools Disciplinary Process
date: 2021-05-01

This section describes the disciplinary process that is normally followed when violations of Middlebury policies are alleged. Where other Middlebury policies specify separate processes, those processes will apply. See, e.g., the [Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy](/assets/anti-harassment-prior-to-8-14-2020.pdf); the [Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic and Dating Violence and Misconduct, and Stalking](/assets/smdvs-prior-to-8-14-2020.pdf); and the [Hazing Policy](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/hazing-policy). Moreover, where applicable laws where the program takes place mandate different procedures or policies, those procedures or policies will apply.

Since Middlebury lacks full judicial authority, such as the power to subpoena or place witnesses under oath, a student's rights cannot be coextensive with or identical to the rights afforded someone accused in a civil or criminal legal proceeding. However, the procedures outlined below and in the [Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and Stalking](https://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/October), [Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy](/assets/anti-harassment-prior-to-8-14-2020.pdf) and [Hazing Policy](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/hazing-policy) are designed to provide fundamental fairness and to protect students from arbitrary or capricious disciplinary action. All judicial affairs officers, human relations officers, deans, directors, and other Middlebury disciplinary authorities shall conduct their proceedings in the spirit of these principles. If exceptional circumstances dictate variation from these procedures, the variation will not invalidate a decision unless it prevented fundamental fairness.

Students found to have violated Middlebury policy may be subject to the full range of disciplinary actions, as applicable, up to and including expulsion from any Language School program or other Middlebury program.

Alleged policy violations should be reported to the dean of Language Schools. The dean or designee (hereinafter referred to as "the dean") is ordinarily responsible for disciplinary action. 

Except in cases of emergency suspension, withdrawal or expulsion as described above, the following disciplinary process will apply. 

In the event that a complaint or report of an alleged policy violation is made against a Language School student, the accused student will be given notice of the alleged violation and an opportunity to respond to the allegations prior to any determination or disciplinary action. The notice may be given orally or in writing. The "opportunity to respond" means that the student will be given an opportunity to meet and/or communicate with the administrator responsible for adjudication. 

The dean will then make a determination, based on a preponderance of the evidence, as to whether the student violated the policy at issue. Formal rules of evidence do not apply in Middlebury conduct proceedings. If a student is found responsible for a policy violation, the dean shall determine what disciplinary or other action should be taken, if any. If the dean determines that the circumstances do not warrant immediate expulsion from the program, the adjudicating official may take other action, including the issuance of warnings, reprimands, probationary status, official College discipline, or suspension from the program. The dean may also assign non-disciplinary action as appropriate, including the issuance of No Contact Orders, room changes, class changes, or other actions as needed. Disciplinary action may be accompanied by notification to the student's undergraduate or graduate institution (or any other program in which the student is involved) and to the parents of dependent students. 

**For non-academic misconduct**

Potential violations of Middlebury-wide, Language School, or General Conduct policies should be reported to the dean of the Language Schools, or designee. For conduct that is unlikely to result in removal or a status change for a student, cases will be assigned to the director of individual language schools for resolution. Sanctions may range from educational sanctions to punitive sanctions to include warnings, reprimands, and probation. For conduct that may result in removal or a status change, the situation will be investigated by Public Safety if necessary and the dean or designee will be responsible for adjudicating the case through an administrative hearing process to determine if there is a policy violation and if so, assign an appropriate sanction up to and including expulsion. At any point in the process the dean or designee may reach out to Community Standards for consultation and support. For Middlebury Undergraduate students, suspension or expulsion may carry forward into the undergraduate academic year.

**For academic misconduct**

Potential violations of Academic Integrity policy should be reported to the director of the individual language school who will notify the dean upon receipt. Directors will be responsible for gathering evidence and materials from the reporting faculty and have an initial meeting with the student to share the concerns. Directors will then share the materials with the dean, or designee for adjudication. At any point in the process directors may reach out to Community Standards for consultation and support. The dean or designee will be responsible for adjudicating the case through an administrative hearing process to determine if there is a policy violation and if so, assign an appropriate sanction up to and including expulsion.

In cases that result in suspension or expulsion, the student may appeal the decision to the Provost, or available academic officer, within three (3) business days of issuance of the determination. Appeals may be granted on the bases of one or more of the following grounds:

*   Discovery of significant new factual material not available at the time to the dean of the original hearing that could have affected the original result; however, prior omission of factual information that the student knew or should reasonably have known about is not grounds for an appeal;
*   Procedural error where the error prevented fundamental fairness;
*   Extreme mitigating circumstances.

The student must submit evidence and/or arguments they believe support any of the three grounds for appeal listed above, and their explanation of the evidence or arguments.  The Provost, or available academic administrator may deny the appeal, or if one or more of the appeal grounds have been met, may:

*   return the case to the dean or designee for reconsideration; or,
*   appoint an alternate disciplinary authority, as appropriate, to review the case.

Absent extenuating circumstances, the provost will notify the student of the appeal decision within five business days of the appeal receipt deadline. This deadline may be extended if warranted by the circumstances, in which case the student will be notified at the time the extension is determined.

The decision is made by the Provost to grant or deny the appeal. Should an appeal be granted, the subsequent determination and/or sanction is/are final.

For the purposes of appeals, the Provost will be used as the appellate authority. However, given the nature of Language Schools and the timing of programs, an appropriate academic administrator may serve as the appellate authority depending on availability.
