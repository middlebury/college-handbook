**Withdrawal Policy**

To withdraw from the Middlebury Language Schools, a student must complete and sign the official withdrawal form from the student's School.

Students who complete check in with the Language Schools, but who decide to leave for any reason before the end of the fifth day of classes will, in addition to forfeiting the non-refundable deposit, be assessed a withdrawal fee of $2,000. This withdrawal fee is assessed because a place has been reserved for the student and cannot, therefore, be filled by another student. The Language Schools will not provide a refund if a student withdraws after the end of the fifth day of classes. Students who cancel before the start date of any program forfeit the $400 non-refundable deposit only.

Students who have utilized Federal Student Aid eligibility (loans and/or grants) will be subject to the Return of Title IV regulations set forth by the US Department of Education.
