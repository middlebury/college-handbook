Total immersion in the Language Schools is based on being in residence seven days a week. Students, faculty, and staff live in dormitories and have meals together in dining halls, organized by language. Dormitories are generally large residence halls and may include shared rooms and bathrooms.  

Language Classes are held Monday through Friday, but students should come prepared to remain on campus and work several hours each day, including weekends, and to interact with other students outside of class, which is a vital part of the curriculum. The Language Schools' co-curricular program is an integral part of the total immersion approach. Students need to participate as fully as possible in the cultural activities planned by each School and are encouraged to make use of the athletic and cultural facilities on campus.

If a student absolutely must be away from the campus overnight, the student needs to consult the school office and leave information in case of an emergency.

Students are required to live in housing provided by Middlebury College where communication is in the target language. The exceptions are to nursing mothers. Students approved for off-campus living must make their own housing arrangements and are responsible for all costs. Students living off-campus are likely to not see that same language acquisition as if they were living on-campus and in full immersion.
