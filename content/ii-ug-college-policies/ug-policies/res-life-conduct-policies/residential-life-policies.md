#### **(1) Fundamental Purposes** {#fundamental}

Middlebury College’s [Community Standards](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/genl-cond-standards) speak directly to the goals and values that underlie all of Middlebury’s residential life policies: safety; respect for self, others and our shared environment; individual responsibility; and fostering a diverse and inclusive community committed to civility, open-mindedness and finding common ground. Enrolled students are required to live on campus for the entirety of their time as a full-time student and participate in the dining plan.  A small number of upper class students may be permitted to live off-campus as authorized by the office of the Residential Life or Dean of Students (DOS).  The procedure to request permission is [below](#requesting). The College assigns housing and reserves the right to change and alter housing assignments to better serve compelling community interests.

#### **(2) Housing options on Campus** {#housing}

At Middlebury College, students are offered more than 60 on-campus buildings for student housing. As a residential college, Middlebury requires that students live on campus until they graduate. A limited number of seniors are released to live off campus for their senior year. First-Year and sophomore students live in traditional residence halls, typically in double rooms with shared community bathrooms. Junior and senior students are able to choose from a variety of housing options, including traditional singles and doubles, and single and double rooms within shared suites, small houses, and a variety of themed communities.

In addition to class year housing, the College also offers Academic, Special Interest, and Social Houses that students can join if they are on campus to pursue common academic, co-curricular, and special interests. Oversight of these houses is the shared responsibility of the Office of the Dean of Students and the academic (in the case of Academic Interest houses) or administrative (in the case of special interest and social houses) department sponsoring the house. Rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors are eligible to reside in Academic, Special Interest and Social Houses.

More information on housing options and housing selection processes can be found at: [https://www.middlebury.edu/residential-life/housing-overview](https://www.middlebury.edu/residential-life/housing-overview)

Middlebury reserves the right to reassign, restrict, and, suspend student housing where that decision will serve a compelling community interest, or in instances where a student has demonstrated a flagrant and/or repeated disregard for the principles set forth in the Handbook. This includes the restriction from participating in room draw and housing selection.

#### **(3) Student Responsibilities and Expectations** {#student}

Residential Living Spaces are provided for actively enrolled Middlebury students only.

Middlebury’s housing spaces provide students the opportunity for independent, adult living, within Middlebury’s residential campus, providing certain facilities to allow students to dine together, do their laundry, study and gather socially, etc.  It is the student’s responsibility to maintain their person, their belongings, and clean and sanitary conditions in dormitory rooms, and they must clear common spaces after personal use. Students who fail to maintain clean and sanitary conditions as assessed by Middlebury College Officials will be subject to Middlebury’s [student conduct process](https://handbook.middlebury.edu/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/general-disciplinary-process) which may result in sanctions and [fines](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/student-financial-services/financial-tools-and-resources/student-financial-services-handbook). 

Students are responsible for what takes place in their rooms and common suite space, including parties and other activities, whether or not they are present. Students who reside in spaces where policy violations occur will be subject to Middlebury’s [student conduct process](https://handbook.middlebury.edu/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/general-disciplinary-process) which may result in sanctions and [fines](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/student-financial-services/financial-tools-and-resources/student-financial-services-handbook). 

Unauthorized room changes are prohibited and subject to Middlebury's [student conduct process and](https://handbook.middlebury.edu/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/general-disciplinary-process) [fines](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/student-financial-services/financial-tools-and-resources/student-financial-services-handbook). Students cannot switch rooms and room codes/keys or change residences without permission from the Office of Residential Life

Students shall not use areas outside of their living spaces for personal storage at any time. The list of spaces excluded from student use includes any roof or outer surface of any Middlebury building. Accessing a roof in any manner or climbing on a building is considered dangerous behavior and is prohibited; fines will be assessed.  Unauthorized access to prohibited areas of Middlebury buildings (e. g. basements, closets, crawlspaces and/or attics) will incur fines (see [section on fines and fees](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/support/sfs/sfs-handbook)).

Students are expected to be considerate of others with respect to noise in the residence halls; see [Noise Policy](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/publicsafety/Noise_Regulationshttps://www.middlebury.edu/office/public-safety/safety-and-security/noise-regulations) for more information. Conduct that creates a public disturbance in a residential space or interferes with another student’s ability to study or sleep is prohibited and may result in disciplinary action.

Students are expected to be responsible for their personal valuables and belongings. Middlebury does not accept responsibility for loss of money or other personal property or damage thereto which may occur in residence halls and elsewhere on campus. Students may wish to insure their property against such loss. Students may be responsible for the cost of damaged property including but not limited to College property and other students’ damaged belongings.

Middlebury provides furniture for student use that is appropriate for the size and capacity for the residential space. Lofts, water beds, air conditioners and large appliances are not permitted and may be removed by Facilities Services or other college officials. Students cannot panel, paint or alter walls, ceilings and floors. Students found to have altered their rooms without proper approval will be fined. Students will be responsible for any charges associated with removal of unauthorized posters, tapestries, or any kind of installations on College buildings.

Students may not remove Middlebury-provided furniture from their bedroom for any reason, including but not limited to bedframes, mattresses, dressers, bookcases, chairs, desks and wardrobes. It is not permitted to move furniture designated for indoor use outdoors to porches, balconies, or lawns. This includes but is not limited to: couches, armchairs, beds, or other upholstered items. Removal of any College furniture without proper permission will result in a fine. Limited medical or ADA exceptions may be granted with appropriate approval. 

Pools, hot tubs, saunas, or soaking tubs are prohibited inside and outside of campus buildings. Trampolines of any size are not permitted. 

To maintain a safe living environment for all students, maximum room occupancy at any time has been established for all room types as the number of two guests per assigned resident plus the total number of residents of the space. For example, a four-person suite with all residents present can have up to eight additional people in their space. Therefore, the total number of people allowed in the suite at once is twelve.

Students are prohibited from engaging in sporting activities, including but not limited to using dartboards, skateboards, bikes, roller skates, scooters, or sleds, and throwing/hitting any type of ball or frisbee in hallways, lounges, common areas, basements, and private spaces of the residence halls. 

**Camping/Overnight Occupancy of Unauthorized Locations**

Students are expected to reside in designated residential spaces overnight. Overnight occupancy of any non-residential space, including common spaces, inside or outside, is prohibited. Camping, defined as the setting up, construction, or overnight occupancy of tents or any other unauthorized structures, or overnight occupancy without tents or structures, of any unauthorized outdoor campus location, without prior written approval of Events Management. See Handbook policy [I.C.9 Camping/Overnight Occupancy of Unauthorized Locations](https://handbook.middlebury.edu/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/camping-overnight-occupancy/) for more information.

#### **(4) Use of Residential Spaces** {#use}

##### **(a) Living and Learning** {#living}

**Residential spaces are ordinarily entitled to a higher degree of privacy than public spaces**. Residences are provided to support the co-curricular learning.  However, the overall safety of our campus and our community justifies balancing individual expectations of privacy vs. community interests.  Solicitation in residence halls for any purpose by persons outside the Middlebury community is prohibited. Residential spaces are intended for student living, not commerce. Students are prohibited from operating a commercial business from any residential space, unless approved as an authorized [student vendor](https://www.middlebury.edu/enterprise-risk-management/compliance-partners/business-services/insurance-and-liability-issues#student-vendors) by Business Services.

##### **(b) Guest Policy** {#guest}

A guest of a student may stay in a dormitory no more than three days in any one term. All guests must register in advance with the Department of Public Safety.  Residential Life staff must be told in advance where the guest is staying. No guests may stay overnight in residential lounges, or stay overnight on campus during academic breaks or when Middlebury is closed. Students are responsible for the behavior of their guests. Middlebury reserves the right to remove any guest whose behavior is not appropriate, and to rescind the privilege of hosting guests. Failure to follow the guest policy will result in fines and loss of privilege to host guests.See [guest policy](https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/use-of-residential-spaces/residential-guests).

##### **(c) Entry by College Officials** {#entry}

**i. Entry into Student Residence Halls, Houses and Suites**  
Middlebury College Officials, including but not limited to the Department of Public Safety and Residential Life, is responsible for patrolling residential areas on campus and may enter student residence halls and houses in order to perform their duties (examples: locking the building, responding to complaints and calls for service, party checks, walk-throughs of hallways, etc.). Since many residential houses need to be patrolled and may require checks or locking, College Officials may enter the communal areas as appropriate. College Officials respect a student's right to privacy and do not enter more private areas such as suites or very small houses without knocking and gaining permission to enter, unless conducting an event with alcohol party check, addressing alleged policy violations, or in accordance with the other entry policies listed above.

**ii. Possession and Securing of Evidence**   
Middlebury College Officials are authorized to enter a student's residence to take possession of and secure evidence of a serious Middlebury policy violation. Department of Public Safety and other Middlebury officials should enter a student's room only under certain circumstances and in conformity with the procedures outlined in Entry into Residential Rooms. In the event that stolen property or prohibited/illegal items are observed, the items will be confiscated, notice will be sent to the Office of Community Standards for appropriate action, and the occupants of the room will be notified.

**Procedure for Entry in Non-Emergency Situation**

*   **Community Service**  
    Middlebury officials may enter a student room to perform a community service: e.g., to turn off an unattended alarm clock or radio, to mitigate property damage, or to allow authorized designees to retrieve residents’ belongings.
*   **Routine Inspections and Repairs**  
    Middlebury conducts routine inspections of student rooms to check on violations of health and safety regulations and to recover misappropriated property. Inspections are held at reasonable times, in a manner that will least inconvenience residents. Students are notified by email at least 24 hours in advance. Students discovered in violation of health and safety regulations, or in possession of stolen property, prohibited items, or illegal goods, are subject to normal Middlebury disciplinary action as appropriate. During vacation periods, student rooms in Middlebury-owned housing are inspected to check heat settings, to ensure that lights and appliances are turned off, and that windows are closed. Following such inspections, or at other times, facilities services personnel may enter student rooms to make repairs. (See [Notification of Entry, below](#notification).) Occasionally, Middlebury officials may need to enter a room for reasons other than those listed in this section, such as to evaluate a room for planning purposes and space needs. In these circumstances, 24-hour notice will be given and the requester will attempt to coordinate a mutually agreeable time with the student. In the event that a potential policy violation is discovered during routine services, the prohibited items may be removed by Middlebury Officials and notice will be sent to the Office of Community Standards for follow up.
*   **Communications Infrastructure Maintenance**  
    Improperly configured or malfunctioning computer or communication equipment can seriously degrade the operation of Middlebury's communication networks. It may be necessary for personnel to enter a student room to confirm the location of such a device, and, if necessary, disconnect it from the network until the situation can be resolved. ITS will attempt to contact the student before entering the room, but time-critical situations, where significant network services are impacted, may require entry without prior approval. Students' computers will not be touched without their prior consent; room entry will be only for the purpose of confirming that the misbehaving computer has been properly identified. For the protection of the student, the Department of Public Safety will be notified if entry is made without prior approval. Any temporary disconnection will be made in the network equipment closet, without directly handling students' property.
    *   If students request assistance from ITS to repair a problem with their network connection, they may give ITS permission to enter the room and disconnect equipment for testing and troubleshooting in their absence. Similarly, Telephone Services personnel may enter student rooms in the residents' absence to effect repairs to voice telephone equipment or infrastructure. (See [Notification of Entry, below](#notification).)

**Procedure for Entry in Emergency Situation**

*   **Emergency Entry**   
    Middlebury officials are authorized to enter a student's room without prior notice in emergency circumstances, such as a fire, fire alarm, fire drill, an immediate threat to health, safety or property, a call for help, report of weapon(s) or what reasonably seems to constitute an emergency situation. Middlebury officials may search the room and/or take other additional steps as necessary to reduce the risk of harm to individuals.
*   **Special Room Inspection**  
    In addition to the circumstances described above, Middlebury officials may initiate entry of a room and/or a room search when there is reason to believe that a serious violation of Middlebury policy has been committed and/or the evidence may be found in a student's room. Searches of this nature will not be conducted without prior authorization of an appropriate senior Middlebury official. When possible, the student or students concerned and a witness shall be present when a room search is conducted. (See [Notification of Entry, below](#notification).)
    *   Students living in Middlebury-owned housing have the right to be free from unlawful room searches conducted by law enforcement officials. In most instances, a lawful search must be conducted pursuant to a warrant issued upon a showing of probable cause. Middlebury officials must arrange with law enforcement authorities to obtain a search warrant before searching a student's room for evidence which they intend to turn over for purposes of criminal prosecution. If a police officer sees a student commit what reasonably appears to be a criminal offense or violation of local ordinances, however, Middlebury will not interfere with the officer's legal pursuit of the student into a dormitory and into a student room. Similarly, a Department of Public Safety officer who sees a student commit what reasonably appears to be a crime or a violation of Middlebury regulations has the right to pursue the student into a dormitory and into a student room.

**Notification of Entry** {#notification}

Whenever a student's dormitory room is entered by a Middlebury Official to meet an emergency, to make a repair, to carry out a community service, to conduct a routine inspection, or to conduct an authorized search, a note will be left indicating the time, date, reason, and name of the Middlebury person or office responsible, unless the occupant of the room is present at the time of entry.

##### **(d) Housing Regulations & Resources** {#housing}

#### **Fire Safety Regulations** {#firesafety}

Any violation of fire safety regulations will result in a [fine](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/support/sfs/sfs-handbook).  Students found responsible will have to pay the additional cost(s) of repair or replacement of damaged equipment or property including associated labor costs.  Students will be subject to disciplinary actions as well.

Outdoor fires may be approved for the Atwater Dining outdoor fireplace and The Knoll (Organic Farm) in Cornwall. Outside burning in other locations requires advance review and approval from Middlebury College and the Town of Middlebury. The location must be reserved and Middlebury College Burn Permit approvals must be obtained in advance of the event.
*   Several College residence halls and lounges have working fireplaces which are inspected annually. Fireplaces deemed safe for use can be confirmed by emailing [facmanage@middlebury.edu](mailto:facmanage@middlebury.edu).  Fires in fireplaces should never be unattended and there should always be a fire extinguisher present in the vicinity when there is any fire in the fireplace. The use of chemical fire starters is prohibited.
*   Tampering with or using fire- or life-safety equipment for anything other than its intended purpose is prohibited and subject to fines. These charges will be borne collectively by the residence hall, room, or suite if the responsible individual(s) cannot be identified. “Fire- and life-safety equipment” includes fire alarms, fire doors, pull stations, extinguishers, hydrants, smoke detectors, smoke detector batteries, carbon monoxide detectors, and sprinklers. Examples of prohibited activities include but are not limited to hanging or adhering anything (clothing, decorations, lights, etc.) to or from fire and life safety equipment; accessing fire escapes for any purpose other than emergency egress from the building; exiting a building from any opening not specifically intended for egress; covering life safety equipment (smoke detectors, sprinklers, etc) in any manner; discharging fire extinguisher contents for non-fire suppression reasons; activating fire alarms or sprinkler systems without indicators of a fire or threat to safety.

Failure to comply will result in confiscation, fines and possible financial liability for related damages or injury.

Fire Safety inspections will be organized and conducted on an on-going basis as deemed appropriate.  Students will be reminded that inspections will occur at the beginning of each semester, and will be advised of the conditions following the inspections.  Any material in violation of the fire safety regulations will be confiscated at the time of the inspection, and the student fined.

#### **Noise Policy** {#noise}

Middlebury seeks to promote the quiet, comfort, and health of the campus, the Town of Middlebury, and surrounding communities through established Courtesy and Quiet Hours. Courtesy hours are always in effect, meaning students are required to be considerate of others at all times with respect to noise in residential spaces, neither causing  nor condoning excessive amounts of noise. Quiet Hours are 10 p.m. - 7 a.m., Sunday through Thursday and 1 a.m. - 7 a.m., Friday through Saturday. Noise from conversations, music, tvs, gaming, phone/video calls, musical instruments, etc. should be kept at a level that doesn’t interfere with other residents’ ability to study or sleep. Should noise concerns arise, students are encouraged to speak to the individual or group themselves first, letting them know their noise level is impacting others and asking them to quiet down. Where problems cannot be resolved in this way, the complaint should be brought to the appropriate member of the Residential Life staff, or the Department of Public Safety. Conduct that creates a public disturbance in a residential space or interferes with another student’s ability to study or sleep is prohibited and may result in disciplinary action.

Students must also abide by all applicable town noise ordinances, including but not limited to the [Town of Middlebury Ordinance for the Regulation of Noise](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/sites/www.middlebury.edu.office/files/2020-10/NoiseGuidelines.pdf?fv=_HhJc6KU). This ordinance prohibits excessive or unnecessary noise, including vocal disturbances and loud music, and includes fines for non-compliance. Procedures on Noise Complaints can be found [here](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/public-safety/safety-and-security/noise-regulations). Students who violate Middlebury policy or local ordinances will be subject to Middlebury's [student conduct process](/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/general-disciplinary-process).

#### **Storage Regulations**

Students leaving Middlebury College at any time are responsible for packing their belongings and arranging for storage or shipping. Storage of student belongings is not provided by the college. Students are expected to keep their belongings within their residential space and are prohibited from using outdoor spaces of small houses, such as porches, patios, balconies, or lawns for storage of personal items.

Bicycle storage is provided in some residential buildings. Items other than bicycles may not be stored in bike rooms.

Social and Specialty House Storage: Houses may only store house items in their houses over the summer recess. Personal items may not be kept in social, specialty, or language house storage at any time.

#### **(5) Changing Housing Assignments or Off-Campus Housing** {#requesting}

**Changing Housing Assignment**  
Students are normally assigned housing by the College through the room draw process. If students are experiencing a roommate conflict, they are highly encouraged to speak with their Residential Life staff member. Unauthorized room changes are prohibited and may be subject to Middlebury’s student conduct process and/or fines.   

**Off campus housing**  
Each year, Middlebury College approves a small number of students to live off campus. Living off campus is a privilege, and students are responsible for their behavior and are held accountable by both the College and the local community. Violations of policy may result in off campus release being revoked. 

Acceptance of an off campus release offer carries through until graduation. Students who then request to move back on campus will be placed on a waiting list and will only receive on-campus housing if it is available. Students on the waitlist cannot participate in room selection processes, and will be assigned housing in whatever space is available if approved to return. There is no guarantee of housing for these students. 

A limited number of releases to live off campus are available for students with three or fewer terms until graduation with prior approval from Residential Life. Students with special medical needs that necessitate a housing accommodation should address their concerns to Residential Life and the Disability Resource Center. Living on campus is an essential component of the educational experience at Middlebury, and requests for off-campus housing on the basis of a medical or ADA-certified need will be considered on a case-by-case basis and will require appropriate documentation. Students who are married or have dependent children living with them are exempted from the residency and board requirements upon providing documentation to Residential Life. 

Students with the status of "special students" are required to live off campus. The number of off-campus residents is based on our commitment to the residential experience and an evaluation of the rental market in the town of Middlebury. Approval may not be granted if a student has been subject to official College discipline or academic failure.  Students living off campus must provide their local address and phone number to Residential Life within the first five days of the term or the Off-Campus Fee Reduction will be forfeited. 

Students who choose to live off-campus without authorization - that is, students who are not granted off-campus status but move off-campus nonetheless - will be subject to Middlebury's [student conduct process](https://handbook.middlebury.edu/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/general-disciplinary-process). 

Students who live off campus are expected to be good neighbors. Students who violate Middlebury policy or local ordinances will be subject to Middlebury's [student conduct process](https://handbook.middlebury.edu/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/general-disciplinary-process).

#### **(6) Termination of a House** {#termination}

The Vice President of Student Affairs (VPSA) will recommend to the President of the College termination of a house at Middlebury in the following circumstances:

a. for disciplinary reasons if there is an extraordinary violation by a house of Middlebury’s rules and regulations for students in houses.

b. for disciplinary reasons if there are repeated violations by a house of Middlebury rules and regulations.  The VPSA may issue appropriate sanctions to a house for violations of rules and regulations. Sanctions may include disciplinary probation, which will involve the loss of the right to hold parties and of other privileges to be specified by the Office of the Dean of Students. The Dean of Students and/or the VPSA will report to the President persistent violations of guidelines and regulations by a  house on probation.

c.  on the grounds of loss of student support and extraordinary expense to Middlebury if room occupancy of the house by members fails to meet the capacity requirements established by the Office of the Dean of Students and the IHC or dorm damages for the house exceed normal wear and tear.

d. The President may seek input from appropriate bodies, such as the Community Council. The President is not required to consult other offices or bodies, however, and reserves the right to take whatever action is necessary, including immediate, indefinite suspension of the house or termination of the house. Indefinite suspension shall mean suspension of the house as a social organization at Middlebury, including loss of the right of members to reside in the house.

#### **(7) Graduating Winter Athlete Housing Policy** {#winterathlete}

Winter season athletes graduating in February and eligible to continue competing with their teams for the remainder of their seasons are welcome to do so, subject to approval by the Director of Athletics.

Since only enrolled students are permitted to live in Middlebury College housing, these athletes may not live on campus and are responsible for arranging their own off campus housing.

Athletes for whom this poses a significant financial hardship may petition the Athletic Policy Committee for an exception to this policy. Petitions will only be considered if there is available housing as determined by Residential Life.

Petitions, submitted by email to the committee chair, are due by November 1. Late petitions will not be accepted and there is no appeal of the committee’s decisions. In addition to the athlete’s level of financial need, their conduct history as recorded with the Office of Community Standards will be considered in rendering a decision.

To preserve petitioners’ privacy, student members of the committee will not be present for deliberations and will not vote. Petitions are decided upon by simple majority of the non-student members of the committee. Approvals to remain on campus may require moving to temporary campus housing if the athlete’s fall or winter term room is needed for students enrolled in the spring term.
