The Survivor's Benefit will be made, by lump sum payment, to the faculty member's surviving spouse, civil union partner, or domestic partner (as documented in the College's Office of Human Resources). If the faculty member has minor children, but no spouse/partner, the benefit will be paid for the benefit of the minor children. *Faculty members without spouses/partners or minor children are not eligible for this benefit.*
