Pet Policy and Requirements for “Dogs at Work”

### 1. Pet Policy

Pets are not allowed in Middlebury buildings including residence halls, dining halls and other food operation areas or indoor eating venues. Service and assistance animals are covered by the [Service & Assistance Animal Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/svc-assist-animals). Exceptions for "dogs at work" are described below.

Animals visiting campus grounds must be on a leash at all times. Animals may not be left unattended or tied to any objects (e.g., structures, trees, or vehicles). All damages caused by an animal are the responsibility of the owner or guardian of the animal at the time of the damage; repairs will be billed accordingly.

Administrative offices open to the public are considered public spaces, and no animals may be brought into them, except Service Animals.

### 2. Exception for "Dogs at Work"

Middlebury employees on the College campus in Vermont may bring their dogs to work in accordance with the requirements of this Policy, detailed below. Dogs demonstrating any aggressive behavior will not be allowed on campus. Bringing a dog to work is a privilege and when other individuals’ health or participation are negatively impacted, this Policy places greater importance on the well-being and full participation of all members of our community than on the preference for bringing a dog to work. Employees may not register dogs that do not belong to them (e.g. friends' or family members' dogs).

**Note:** Service dogs are not required to be registered under this policy. Please see the [Service Animal Policy](/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/svc-assist-animals) for more information.

**Dogs May Not Be Registered In These Buildings (this list is subject to change at any time)**

* Emma Willard House
* McCardell Bicentennial Hall (dogs are not allowed in this building at any time)
* The Marble Works (dogs are not allowed in this building at any time)
* 700 Exchange Street (dogs are not allowed in this building at any time)
* Peterson Family Athletic Complex (exceptions may be made for specific locations)
* The Mahaney Center for the Arts (exceptions may be made for specific locations)
* Davis Library

Faculty and staff with private offices or faculty and staff who share an office may bring their registered dogs to work during [standard business hours](https://handbook.middlebury.edu/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/employment/scheduling-hours-operation/) only, so long as they follow these steps for approval:

a. The dog owner must first obtain permission from their supervisor/department chair/VP by completing Part I of the [approval and registration form](static/assets/dog-at-work-registration-form_2024.pdf). To be eligible for approval, employees must have a private office. With the approval of a supervisor/department chair/VP, two employees who share a single office may be permitted to register their dog. However, only one dog is permitted in a single office at any given time.

b. The dog owner must complete Part II of the registration form and email a scanned copy of the completed form (Parts I and II), plus a digital photograph of their dog, to [dogsatwork@middlebury.edu](mailto:dogsatwork@middlebury.edu) (please write “Dog Registration” in the subject line). Note that the registration process requires that your dog have a current dog license in the owner’s hometown and a copy of the license must be provided annually. No dog may be permitted on campus that is not fully vaccinated and current on all vaccinations (this includes puppies).

c. Once final approval is granted by the Office of General Counsel & Risk Management, and a sign to hang on your door has been received, only then may the dog be brought to your office. If you have not received notification of final approval from the Office of General Counsel & Risk Management, your dog has not yet been approved to come to work and may not be brought to the office until it has been received. 

d. When the dog is on campus, the faculty or staff member is responsible for ensuring that the Conduct Requirements spelled out below are followed.

**Conduct Requirements for "Dogs at Work" Program**

* Owners must register and receive approval of their dog with the Office of General Counsel & Risk Management before bringing them to work or in their office.
* Owners must post a sign on the office door when their registered dog is present. (A sign will be sent in campus mail once the dog registration has received final approval.)
* Dogs must remain with owners at all times. Dogs running freely through hallways and buildings is a direct violation of this policy and grounds for immediate termination of registration.
* Owners must keep dogs on leashes at all times when not in their office. Dogs may not be off leash outside of the owner’s office, including in public areas inside or outside a building.
* Owners may not bring dogs to classrooms, meeting spaces, conference rooms, or other public gathering spaces.
* Owners may not bring dogs to dining halls and other food operation areas or indoor eating venues.
* Owners are advised not to leave their dogs alone in their offices. If they must do so, owners are strongly encouraged to crate their dogs.
* Dogs may only be brought to work during standard operating hours and are not allowed in any Middlebury building overnight.
* Owners must ensure that dogs are appropriately cleaned and groomed while on campus.
* Owners are required to clean up after their dogs, both inside and outside the office, and building.
* Owners will be financially responsible for any damage or cleaning costs resulting from the dog.
* Owners are responsible for cleaning their own offices. Custodians will not clean offices where dogs are registered, regardless of how often the dog is present in the office.
* Owners must make alternate arrangements to meet with students, co-workers, visitors and/or vendors who are allergic to or uncomfortable when dogs are present in the office. It is the responsibility of the owner to notify visitors beforehand that a dog will be present in the office.

### 3. Enforcement

a. Concerns about Dogs at Work should first be directed to the Vice-President/Dean/Supervisor for the office or program where the dog owner works, if possible. Otherwise, issues and complaints about dogs at work should be sent to [dogsatwork@middlebury.edu](mailto:dogsatwork@middlebury.edu) for further handling.

b. The Department of Public Safety shall not be contacted with dog complaints, with the exception of emergencies or serious incidents involving a dog, such as a dog bite.

c. Violation of any of the Conduct Requirements is a basis for terminating the registration of a dog. Failure to comply with the Conduct Requirements may result in fines, in addition to termination of registration, and repeated violations may be subject to additional sanctions.

Any questions about this policy may contact [dogsatwork@middlebury.edu](mailto:dogsatwork@middlebury.edu).
