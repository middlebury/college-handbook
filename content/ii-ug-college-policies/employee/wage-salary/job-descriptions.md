Job descriptions define the primary purpose of a job, its core responsibilities or essential functions, and the skills, abilities, education, or experience needed to be successful in the position, along with any physical demands or working conditions. Human Resources maintains a database of staff job descriptions and provides support in creating and/or revising them. Supervisors can work with their Vice President to submit updates or new descriptions to Human Resources through the Semi-annual Request Process.  Job descriptions are available anytime at: [https://www.middlebury.edu/human-resources/self-service-resources/staff-compensation-program/job-descriptions](https://www.middlebury.edu/human-resources/self-service-resources/staff-compensation-program/job-descriptions).
