title: 6.4 Shift Differentials

Middlebury provides a shift differential - an hourly wage supplement - for non-exempt employees who work between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., as well as during weekends. The differential acknowledges that these hours, while essential to operations, are generally more challenging for staff to work. 

Shift Identification:

* Day Shift Period: Hours between 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.
* Evening Shift Period: Hours between 6:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m.
* Night Shift Period: Hours between 12:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m.
* Weekend Shift Period: Hours between Saturday 12:00 a.m. and Monday 12:00 a.m. 

All non-exempt employees earn an additional $1.50 per hour for each hour worked in the evening shift period, $3.00 per hour for each hour worked in the night shift period, and $1.00 per hour for each hour worked during the weekend shift period. Shift differentials are automatically calculated in Oracle based on recorded start and stop times and apply only to hours worked. They are included in the calculation of overtime pay rates. When multiple differentials apply (e.g., night shifts on weekends), both are paid. Differentials are not applied to CTO, SLR, bereavement, holiday, and other time off.

Departmental exceptions to this policy require approval from Human Resources. Positions not eligible for shift differentials include tipped roles and student jobs (a complete list is available from Human Resources).  Shift differential rates are subject to periodic review.
