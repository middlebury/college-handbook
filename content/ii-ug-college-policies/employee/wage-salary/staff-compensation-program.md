The compensation team evaluates pay practices, conducts annual market analyses, participates in compensation surveys, and supports managers and Human Resources with position descriptions, job analysis, and compensation recommendations. Positions at Middlebury are placed into grades based upon market benchmarking and internal review. Each grade includes multiple skill matrix levels, each with a corresponding salary.

Middlebury College is committed to maintaining a compensation program that attracts, retains, and rewards a qualified and diverse workforce.  As outlined in the Compensation Administration Guidelines, the program is guided by the following framework for determining compensation:

* [Role](https://www.middlebury.edu/human-resources/role)
* [Individual](https://www.middlebury.edu/human-resources/individual)
* [Discretion](https://www.middlebury.edu/human-resources/discretion)
* [Pay Grades](https://www.middlebury.edu/human-resources/self-service-resources/staff-compensation-program/pay-grades)
* [Skill Matrix Ranges](https://www.middlebury.edu/human-resources/self-service-resources/staff-compensation-program/pay-grades/skill-matrix-ranges)
