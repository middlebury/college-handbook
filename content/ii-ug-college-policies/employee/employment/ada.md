Middlebury College recognizes and supports the standards set forth in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the ADA Amendments Acts of 2008 (ADAAA), and similar state laws, which are designed to eliminate discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities. The College does not discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities in any aspect of the employment relationship, and does provide reasonable accommodations as required by law to otherwise qualified employees or applicants with disabilities.Â Employment opportunities or privileges will not be denied to an otherwise qualified employee or applicant because of the need for reasonable accommodation of the individual's disability. Discrimination based on an employee's or applicant's association with a disabled individual is also forbidden. Employees with ADA-related concerns should contact Human Resources.
