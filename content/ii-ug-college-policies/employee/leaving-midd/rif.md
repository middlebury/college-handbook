title: 9.5 Reduction in Force

A Reduction in Force (RIF) is defined as the laying off of more than one or consistent with Vermont law for staff employees. The purpose of the procedure is to ensure appropriate consultation and communication within the College community as well as to clarify procedures to be followed. The procedures go into effect at the time a possible RIF is announced. This procedure does not apply to seasonal employees, employees hired for fixed periods of time, or employees dismissed as an outcome of performance concerns.

Managers considering reorganization of their units should consult with Human Resources. They will be expected to complete a specific process as outlined in the Reorganization and Severance Policy, in partnership with Human Resources.
