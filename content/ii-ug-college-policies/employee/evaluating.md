Middlebury is committed to a model that centers holistic and honest feedback up, down and across our teams and prioritizes personal and professional growth on an ongoing basis. Supervisors and staff are encouraged to have early and frequent feedback conversations. The goal of the conversations should be to reflect on successes, challenges, and opportunities moving forward.

Supervisors and employees should have frequent conversations throughout the year and are expected to meet in alignment with our current tools and practices.
