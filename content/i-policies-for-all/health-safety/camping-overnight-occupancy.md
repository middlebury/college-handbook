In order to carry out its educational mission, Middlebury is committed to maintaining a safe, secure, and healthy environment in which our students and employees live and work. Therefore, overnight occupancy of any non-residential space, indoors or outdoors, on any Middlebury property[\[1\]](#_ftn1), is prohibited.  

Additionally, camping on any Middlebury property, in or under Middlebury structures, or in Middlebury buildings, at any time during the day or night is prohibited without the prior written approval of Events Management or the Vice President’s Office at the Institute. For this purpose, camping includes but is not limited to:

*   The setting up, construction of, establishment of, or attempt to establish, temporary or permanent sleeping/living quarters anywhere on a Middlebury campus other than residence halls or other Middlebury managed housing;
*   Overnight occupancy and/or presence of tents, tarps, lean-to's, bedding, hammocks, cots, or similar unauthorized structures;
*   Sleeping outdoors with or without a tent, tarp, lean-to, bedding, hammock, cot, structure, protection, or similar unauthorized device between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.;
*   Sleeping in or under any parked vehicle beyond the purpose of a short nap (e.g. work breaks or study breaks).

This policy applies to all Middlebury students, faculty, and staff, as well as Middlebury affiliates, contractors and visitors. Students are expected to reside in designated residential spaces overnight. Students, faculty, and staff in violation of this policy may be referred for discipline. Any individual who refuses to comply with this policy may also be issued a No Trespass Notice (NTO) or may be subject to removal by law enforcement.
