title: C.6. Weapons Policy
date: 2021-05-01
---
The use and possession of weapons, including ammunition ("ammo"), are prohibited on Middlebury property and at Middlebury sponsored events, including in motor vehicles. Antique, imitation, and replicas of weapons and ammo are also prohibited unless they are possessed or stored in accordance to the Exceptions section below. Discovery of a weapon or ammo on Middlebury property or carried by a person (openly or concealed) on Middlebury property, or at Middlebury sponsored events, or any other violation of the weapons policy, shall result in confiscation of the weapon or ammo. Disciplinary action against the owner and/or person in possession may be taken, which may include but not be limited to removal from Middlebury property, arrest, expulsion, suspension, probation, discipline, dismissal or termination.

This policy applies to all faculty, staff, students, employees, and visitors at all Middlebury property, including those who have a valid permit to carry a concealed weapon. This policy shall not apply to a law enforcement officer while engaged in law enforcement duties, or an active duty member of the armed forces.

Definitions of key terms are provided below.

**Exceptions**

1.  Matriculated students and students enrolled in a Middlebury program and living on a Vermont campus are permitted, in accordance with Vermont law, to possess weapons for hunting and sporting related activities only, such as target practice.  Assault weapons and semi-automatic weapons with rapid-fire capability are expressly prohibited.  A handgun is only allowed to be on campus if it is a duty weapon issued or authorized by the student-owner’s employer.  
2.  All permitted weapons and ammo must be registered with and stored at the Department of Public Safety located at 125 South Main Street, Middlebury, Vermont. Requirements for storage in Vermont can be found on the Department of Public Safety website.  The Institute of International Studies at Monterey does not allow or provide for weapons storage.
3.  Due to their realistic likeness to weapons and potential for causing community alarm, possession or use of toy or replica weapons in a Middlebury-sanctioned activity or academic program must be approved in advance by the Associate Vice President of Safety, or designee, in Middlebury, or Campus Security in Monterey.
