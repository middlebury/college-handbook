This Poster, Chalking, Banners and Other Displays policy applies to all Middlebury property[\[1\]](#_ftn1) except students’ private residential spaces, and private offices. Individual campus departments or offices may determine their own poster procedures, but they are expected to be consistent in intent and spirit with the policies presented here. 

**Posters**

*   The display of posters, flyers, and similar items (collectively referred to as “posters” here) in campus spaces by non-Middlebury ID holders is prohibited.
*   Posters may be displayed by registered student organizations, Middlebury offices or departments, or by individual Middlebury ID holders with prior permission from the Office of Student Engagement (Middlebury College campus) or Office of Student Services (Middlebury Institute campus).
*   Posters may only be placed on approved bulletin boards and public poster areas. Posters placed elsewhere, including but not limited to doors, walls, windows, buildings, lampposts, trees or stairwells, will be removed.
*   All posters must clearly and conspicuously identify and include contact information for the group or individual responsible for them and may be removed if this requirement is not met.  
*   Posters must only be affixed with materials that do not cause permanent damage to surfaces.
*   Individuals or groups may not remove, alter or deface posters.
*   Those hanging posters may remove their own.
*   Posters larger than 11”x17” are not permitted without prior approval from the Student Engagement Office.
*   Posters are ordinarily removed from all campus display spaces on the 1st and 15th of each month, or the nearest business day.

**Chalking**  
Chalking is permitted, subject to the following provisions:

*   Only registered student organizations may chalk, in order to promote their activities and events.
*   Chalking is only permitted on concrete outdoor sidewalks and the designated chalkboards in areas such as McCullough and Bicentennial Hall. Chalking is not permitted on any non-designated surfaces, vertical surfaces, buildings, walls, or on any surfaces that are marble, brick, or tiled.
*   Only water-soluble chalk may be used.
*   Like posters, chalkings must clearly identify the organization responsible for them and may be removed if this requirement is not met.  
*   Chalkings are ordinarily removed by Facilities Services within 3 business days in any event

**Banners**

*   Registered student organizations, Middlebury offices or departments, or Middlebury ID-card holders may request to hang a banner by contacting Events Management (Middlebury College campus) or Office of Student Services (Middlebury Institute campus) at least two (2) full business days before the desired day for bannering.
*   Requests are confirmed on a first-come, first-served basis.
*   All banners must clearly and conspicuously identify and include contact information for the group or individual responsible for them and may be removed if this requirement is not met.
*   Banners must only be affixed with materials that do not cause permanent damage to surfaces.
*   The banner location can only be reserved for two consecutive business days.
*   The student organization is responsible for hanging and removing their banner. 

**Other Displays**  
All other displays in campus spaces are subject to this policy. The College reserves the sole right to determine what constitutes a display under this policy, consistent with our commitment to [open expression](https://handbook.middlebury.edu/pages/i-policies-for-all/genl-principles/freedom-of-expression/).

**Violation of College Policies**  
Posters or other displays that violate College policies, including the College’s [Non-Discrimination](https://handbook.middlebury.edu/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy/), [Respectful Behavior](https://handbook.middlebury.edu/pages/i-policies-for-all/genl-principles/respectful-behavior/), or other policy, will be removed.

**Reporting of Concerns**  
Concerns that a poster or other display does not comply with this policy should be reported to sao@middlebury.edu. Posters that do not comply with this policy are subject to immediate removal and may result in individual or organizational disciplinary proceedings.

Concerns about the content or viewpoint expressed in a poster or other display may also be reported to the [Civil Rights and Title IX Office](https://www.middlebury.edu/title-IX). Consistent with our [Policy on Open Expression](https://www.middlebury.edu/title-IX), removal of a poster or other display based on content/viewpoint is rare, and will be done at sole discretion of a rapid response team consisting of appointees from the Offices of the Provost, Vice President for Student Affairs, Vice President of Student Affairs, Vice President of Human Resources, and Department of Public Safety or Campus Security, as applicable to the circumstances.
