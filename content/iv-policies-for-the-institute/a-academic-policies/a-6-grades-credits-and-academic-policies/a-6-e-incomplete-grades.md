title: A.6.e. Incomplete Grades
date: 09/19/2025

A grade of incomplete (I) may be assigned by the instructor when a student has done acceptable work in the majority of course requirements or assignments but cannot complete all course work for reasons of illness, emergency, or legitimate extenuating circumstances. If a student has **not** done acceptable work in the majority of course requirements or assignments prior to the illness or emergency that prevented completion of the course, a letter grade shall be assigned. An “I” is not appropriate for cases in which the principal requirement for the course is unfinished by the end of an academic term, e.g., a Capstone, Thesis, Business Plan, or Program Portfolio (please see below, Assignment of “In Progress”).

Process for assigning and resolving an Incomplete:

*   The instructor submits a grade of Incomplete to the Records Office and the associate dean of academic operations, accompanied by a written agreement with the student regarding the work to be completed and the deadline for completion. This completion deadline should be as early as possible and may under no circumstances exceedthe last day of classes of the following semester unless an extension is approved by the associate dean of academic operations due to extenuating circumstances.  Incomplete grades issued in Summer Term must be resolved by the end of the fall semester.  Incomplete grades issued in Jterm must be resolved by the end of the fall semester.   Submission of a final grade to resolve the Incomplete is due to the Records office by the grade deadline of the semester in which the grade is due. 
*   The instructor evaluates the completed work as soon after its submission as possible. The instructor shall complete and submit a Change of Grade form to the Records Office to replace the “I” with the appropriate grade.
*   An “I” that is not changed by this procedure becomes a permanent grade on the student’s transcript. In this case, the "I" is not used to calculate the Grade Point Average.
*   If a grade of Incomplete in a course required for the student's degree is not resolved according to the above provisions, the student may be required to repeat the course (or an appropriate equivalent), paying additional tuition, if necessary, to satisfy the requirement of the degree.

**Note:** International students with a grade of Incomplete (I) in their final semester should consult with International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) regarding the implications for their immigration status. F-1 or J-1 students cannot request a SEVIS program extension based on an “I”  grade. They also cannot legally remain in the U.S. beyond their F-1 or J-1 grace period (60 or 30 days after their SEVIS program end date) to complete the Incomplete.
