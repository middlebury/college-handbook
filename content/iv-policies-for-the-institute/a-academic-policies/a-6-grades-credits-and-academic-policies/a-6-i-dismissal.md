title: A.6.i. Dismissal
date: 2021-05-01
---
A student who fails to make satisfactory academic progress for two consecutive semesters or who otherwise fails to achieve relief from academic probation status by the end of the following semester is subject to immediate dismissal.

Following notice of such dismissal, an application for readmission will be considered only after one full calendar year has elapsed. Students may be granted or denied readmission only at the discretion of the Institute. Following readmission after academic dismissal, the student is on academic probation for the first subsequent semester.

For international students, dismissal from the Institute has a direct effect on their immigration status and their ability to remain legally in the U.S. International students should consult with International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) about their options.
