A credit hour is an amount of work, represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement, that is an institutionally established equivalency reasonably approximating not less than—

(1) One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks in one semester, or the equivalent amount of work over a different period of time; or

(2) At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, and other academic work leading to the awarding of credit hours.  Credit is not awarded for stand-alone internships. Internships for which credit is awarded must be an integral part of a more extended academic activity for which credit hours have been assigned based on the definition above.

The following system of grading is used at the Middlebury Institute:

<table><tbody><tr><td>A and A+</td><td>4.00 grade points per credit</td></tr><tr><td>A- (minus)</td><td>3.67</td></tr><tr><td>B+ (plus)</td><td>3.33</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>3.00</td></tr><tr><td>B-</td><td>2.67</td></tr><tr><td>C+</td><td>2.33</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>2.00</td></tr><tr><td>C-</td><td>1.67</td></tr><tr><td>D+</td><td>1.33</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>1.00</td></tr><tr><td>D-</td><td>0.67</td></tr><tr><td>F (Fail)</td><td>0.00</td></tr><tr><td>P (Pass)</td><td>Credit for course, no grade points</td></tr><tr><td>NP (No Pass)</td><td>No grade points or credit</td></tr><tr><td>I (Incomplete)</td><td>No grade points or credit</td></tr><tr><td>W (Withdrawal with permission)</td><td>No grade points or credit</td></tr><tr><td>AU (Audit)</td><td>No grade points or credit</td></tr><tr><td>IP (In Progress)</td><td>No grade points or credit</td></tr></tbody></table>

There is no other system of grading or grading category at the Middlebury Institute other than those listed above.

Except for grades of “I’ and “IP,” all grades are considered final when reported by a faculty member at the end of a semester or marking period. A change of grade may be requested **only** when a calculation, clerical, administrative, or recording error is discovered in the original assignment of a course grade or when a decision is made to change the grade as a result of the disputed academic evaluation procedure. Grade changes necessitated by a calculation, clerical, administrative, or recording error must be reported within a period of six months from the time the grade is awarded. **No grade may be changed as the result of a re-evaluation of a student’s work or the submission of supplemental work** following the close of a semester or marking period. The Records Office shall only accept permissible changes of grade upon written approval of the associate dean of academic operations, who shall first verify that the change of grade request satisfies established criteria.
