title: A.4.a. Change of Degree Program
date: 2021-05-01
---
The process for changing degree programs includes the following steps:

*   The student discusses the matter with their advisor, including eligibility and possible implications for degree requirements and degree completion.
*   The advisor directs the student to file a new application with the admissions office and may also be subject to an additional Student Tuition Recovery Fund (STRF) fee.Â 
    *   NOTE: Effective April 1, 2024, the Student Tuition Recovery Fund (STRF) assessment rate will change from two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50) per one thousand dollars ($1,000) of institutional charges to zero dollars ($0.00) per one thousand dollars ($1,000) of institutional charges.
*   Once a change of program has been reviewed and approved by all relevant parties, the advisor works with the student to develop a new plan of study for the new degree. The associate dean of academic operations may be consulted for questions regarding credit that can be applied to the new degree. For more information on using existing credit toward language requirements of the new degree (if applicable) see section A.5.F.3.
