**A. Credit Limit for Non-Degree Students**

Non-degree students may register for up to eight (8) credits per semester without formal application to a degree program. Non-degree students attending MIIS as part of a Middlebury College or Language Schools degree program, as well as students attending MIIS via an exchange agreement, are not included in the eight (8) credit per semester maximum.  International students in the U.S. in an F-1 or J-1 visa status pursuing a non-degree program must be enrolled full time and may not drop below 12 credits without authorization from the International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS)..

**B. Academic Credit for Non-Degree Students**

Credit earned while attending the Middlebury Institute as a non-degree student may be applied later to a degree or certificate program with approval of the program chair and associate dean of academic operations.

**C. Conversion of Non-Degree Students to Degree Status**

Non-degree students who wish to change to a degree or certificate program must reapply through the Admissions Office at least one month in advance of the semester in which the change is to become effective. To allow sufficient time to obtain an immigration status that allows for full-time, in-person enrollment, international students should apply for admission to the program no later than the start of the semester before the anticipated change.  All requirements for admission to degree programs in effect at that time must be met. No application fee is required if the application fee was paid initially.

**D. Admission Provisions for Non-Native Speakers of English**

Non-degree students who are non-native speakers of English must meet the same minimum English language requirement as degree applicants for the program in which they wish to take courses.
