title: A.4.b. Admission to a Second Graduate Degree Program
date: 2021-05-01
---
Students enrolled in a graduate program at the Middlebury Institute who wish to add a second degree must apply for the second degree through the Admissions Office. No application fee is required. A second degree requires a minimum of an additional thirty (30) credits in residence beyond the requirements for the first degree, as well as satisfaction of all of the core requirements of the second degree and may also be subject to an additional Student Tuition Recovery Fund (STRF) fee.  Effective April 1, 2024, the Student Tuition Recovery Fund (STRF) assessment rate will change from two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50) per one thousand dollars ($1,000) of institutional charges to zero dollars ($0.00) per one thousand dollars ($1,000) of institutional charges.  International students must notify ISSS of the addition of a second degree program no later than 30 days before their current program end date.
