title: A.7.a. Full-Time and Part-Time Enrollment Status
date: 2021-05-01
---
In the fall and spring semesters, a student is considered full-time when enrolled for twelve or more credits, three-quarter time when enrolled for nine to eleven (9-11) credits, half time when enrolled for six to eight (6-8) credits, and less than half time when enrolled for fewer than six (6) credits. A student who is half time or less than half time is considered part-time.

**B. Summer Session**

During the regular summer session, a full-time load is defined as six (6) credits.

**International students** are required to enroll full-time for a minimum of 12 credits each semester. International students may carry fewer than 12 credits in their final semester ONLY if they are enrolled in all credits they need to finish their degree and they have notified International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) prior to the start of their final semester. Otherwise they may not drop below 12 credits without prior authorization, if eligible, from International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS).
