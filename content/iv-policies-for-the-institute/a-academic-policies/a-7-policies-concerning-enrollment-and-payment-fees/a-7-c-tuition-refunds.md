If a student voluntarily withdraws from the Middlebury Institute at any time during the academic year after the academic term has begun, or officially drops below a full-time load, tuition (less deposit) shall be refunded as follows:

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Time of Withdrawal from the Middlebury Institute</strong></td><td><strong>Percent Tuition Reversed</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Before the 11th day of the academic term</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>11th through 20th day of the academic term</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td>21st through 45th day of the academic term</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>After the 45th day of the academic term</td><td>0%</td></tr></tbody></table>

Weekend workshops and other brief courses dropped by 4 P.M. on the last business day a week before they begin, will have the full amount of the tuition credited to their account, if the drop brings them below half time.Â  Full time students that remain full time after they drop are not eligible for any tuition to be reversed. After that deadline, there is no tuition reversed.

**The summer refund schedule is as follows:**

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Time of Withdrawal from Summer Program</strong></td><td><strong>Percent Tuition Refunded or Credited</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Before the 11th day of the term</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>11th through 15th day of the term</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td>16th day through 23rd day of the term</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>After 24th day of the term</td><td>0%</td></tr></tbody></table>

Non-credit, fee-based programs as well as programs offered through Middlebury Institute Online publish their own refund schedules. Students should consult with the program and/or the Middlebury Institute Online handbook.

**Note:** Federal financial aid has different refund rules. Students receiving Federal financial aid or VA educational benefits should contact the Office of Student Financial Services before withdrawing.
