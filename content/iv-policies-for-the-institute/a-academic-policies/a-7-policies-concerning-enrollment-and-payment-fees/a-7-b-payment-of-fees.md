title: A.7.b. Payment of Fees
date: 2021-05-01
---
Any outstanding tuition/fee balance must be paid in full before a student is eligible to register.

Any credit card payment made to a student account in excess of the balance (less anticipated financial aid) will be refunded to the credit card utilized for payment.

Tuition is due by 4pm on the first day of classes each semester.

**Late Fees:**

The Middlebury Institute provides an add/drop period during the first two weeks of the semester, which allows students to modify their enrollment by adding or dropping classes.  Any student whose tuition and fees are not paid in full by the Monday following the second week of classes will be assessed a $250 late fee.  A late fee will trigger a hold on the student’s account, preventing their ability to register for future credits until their tuition and fees are paid in full.

Students who have provided documentation to the Bursar of a third party payment (such as an organization, government, or third party entity) will not be charged a late fee.

Any student whose tuition and fees remain unpaid after the 20th day of classes each semester will be contacted by the dean and will be asked to provide details on when their tuition will be paid.  Students will face administrative withdrawal at the discretion of the dean if they cannot provide a guarantee of payment satisfactory to their dean and the Institute.

Students who are administratively withdrawn may not return to the Institute for future enrollment until their tuition balance has been paid in full and they are in good financial and academic standing.
