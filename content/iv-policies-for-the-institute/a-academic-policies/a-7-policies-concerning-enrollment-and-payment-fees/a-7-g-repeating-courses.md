title: A.7.h. Repeating Courses
date: 2021-05-01
---
A student may repeat a course by registering for the course again and paying the appropriate fees. When a student repeats a course, the grade recorded the first time the course was completed remains permanently on the student’s transcript. However, only the new grade will be considered in the calculation of the student’s Grade Point Average.  Students can only receive Federal Financial Aid to repeat a course if they failed that course, or did not receive a passing grade in a required course.
