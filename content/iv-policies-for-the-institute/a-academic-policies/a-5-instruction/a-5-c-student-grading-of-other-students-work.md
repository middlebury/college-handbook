title: A.5.c. Student Grading of Other Students' Work
date: 2021-05-01
---
Graduate assistants or work-study students acting as teaching assistants shall not participate in the evaluation or grading of the work of other students. However, graduate or work-study students may occasionally be asked to grade multiple-choice type questions when there is a standardized answer key. In general, faculty supervised correction is permitted provided the work can be assessed objectively.
