The degree programs at the Middlebury Institute offer experiential learning experiences that are either credit or non-credit bearing.

Internships are a valuable and typical component of the MIIS educational experience. Internships generally do not carry academic credit, although academic credit can be arranged in exceptional cases by means of a directed study. In general, students should consult with their academic and career advisor about internship opportunities. In addition:

●     For **language internships,** students should consult with the language studies advisor.

●     In order to ensure compliance with visa regulations, international students should contact ISSS and their academic advisor to discuss the possibility of earning credit for internships.
