Students enrolled at the Middlebury Institute may elect to apply to pursue studies external to the Middlebury Institute, including study abroad, for academic credit as part of a Middlebury Institute degree program. The typical period for external study or study abroad is one semester. Written approval must be obtained in advance from the relevant  program chair and the associate dean of academic operations using the [Petition to Transfer Course Credits form](https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/sites/www.middlebury.edu.institute/files/2019-09/transfer_petition_revised_030614x-eFillable_0.pdf?fv=4bhz33cx).  Financial aid arrangements must be made in advance with the Office of Student Financial Services, and such arrangements shall apply only to approved programs. Also see sections below on Transfer of Academic Credit from Other Academic Institutions.  International students must notify International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) of any planned study abroad plans no later than the start of the semester before the study abroad experience will begin.
