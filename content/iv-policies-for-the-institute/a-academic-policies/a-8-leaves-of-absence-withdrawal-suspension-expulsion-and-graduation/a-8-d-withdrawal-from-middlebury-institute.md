title: A.8.d. Withdrawal from the Middlebury Institute
date: 2021-05-01
---
A student who wishes to withdraw from the Middlebury Institute for academic or personal reasons may petition to do so at any time before the end of any semester by completing a [withdrawal petition form](https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/sites/default/files/2019-09/Withdrawal%20Petition%20rev.Mar2017-eFillable_0.pdf). International students must inform International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) of their intended withdrawal date.  Any refund of tuition will be based on the date of withdrawal (refer to [A.7.b., Payment of Fees](https://handbook.middlebury.edu/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/a-academic-policies/a-7-policies-concerning-enrollment-and-payment-fees/a-7-b-payment-of-fees/)). Students who plan to return to the Middlebury Institute to complete their degree program should consult the Leave of Absence and Readmission to the Middlebury Institute policies, before completing the withdrawal petition.

If a student withdraws with a disciplinary matter, sanction, or appeal pending, the withdrawal will be considered a resignation from MIIS, and the student will have given up the opportunity to return to any MIIS program. The student’s official status at MIIS will reflect the point in the process at which they withdrew, and the nature of the finding and sanction, as appropriate. Examples include but are not limited to "Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Matter Pending," "Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Sanction Pending," and "Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Appeal Pending."

In extraordinary circumstances, the appropriate supervisory authority may, after appropriate consultation, review of the case, and in consideration of MIIS’ best interests, grant permission for a student to withdraw from MIIS when a disciplinary matter is pending. If the student is readmitted to MIIS, the disciplinary matter must be resolved either before the student's return, or immediately upon the student's return (as determined by MIIS).
