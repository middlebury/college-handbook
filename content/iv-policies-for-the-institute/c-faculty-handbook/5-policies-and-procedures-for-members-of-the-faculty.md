#### **C.5.a. Categories of Faculty** {#categories}

The **Regular Faculty** of the Middlebury Institute is committed to excellence in teaching, scholarship, and service to the Institute.

A “regular faculty member” is appointed to the rank of professor, associate professor, or assistant professor as a result of a search conducted by a committee comprising current faculty and administrators. During the search process, input from students and alumni may be sought.

A regular faculty member is appointed to a renewable three- or six-year term. A regular faculty member is eligible to apply for sabbaticals and faculty development grants.

A regular faculty member is appointed to either a full- or a part-time schedule each semester, as stipulated in the letter of appointment and performs such additional tasks as are normally expected of faculty at institutions of higher education. In addition to teaching and scholarship/professional engagement, these duties include, but are not limited to, thesis direction and reading; directed study supervision; student advising; attendance at faculty meetings; committee membership and participation in institutional governance.

The regular faculty of the Institute are responsible for teaching, curriculum development, and maintaining professional currency in their fields of expertise.  Faculty are also expected to be available to students and colleagues and to comply with any Institutional requirements governing that availability.

**Professors of Professional Practice**: Appointments to the rank of Assistant/ Associate/ full Professor of Professional Practice are made only to practitioners who have developed to the satisfaction of the regular faculty the Dean of Teaching, Learning, and Faculty Development, and VPAA, a high level of expertise in fields of special importance to MIIS academic programs, and who also demonstrate a deep commitment to teaching and professional practice. Professors of Professional Practice shall normally hold at least a Master’s degree. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to, teaching and conducting and supervising professional practice and research. Professors of Professional Practice are normally full time, regular faculty members and are appointed, following the procedures prescribed in section [C.5.b](https://www.middlebury.edu/handbook/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/c-faculty-handbook/5-policies-and-procedures-for-members-of-the-faculty#appointment), at the rank of Assistant, Associate or full Professor, according to relevant experience and qualifications. They are subject to regular evaluation procedures, with quality of teaching and professional practice as the principal criteria, provide service to the Institute, and are eligible to apply for sabbatical leave and development grants.

**Affiliated Faculty** of the Middlebury Institute are engaged in teaching and research. They are either full- or part-time employees each semester, as stipulated in their contracts, and may perform such additional tasks as are normally expected of university-affiliated faculty. These include, but are not limited to, student advising, directed study supervision, curriculum development; attendance at faculty meetings, and maintaining professional currency in their fields of expertise. Affiliated faculty fall into five categories:

i. **Visiting Professors** offer expertise that expands the current offerings in the curriculum. For appointment as a visiting professor, a candidate normally must have earned a doctorate, or the highest degree available in the candidate’s field of specialization, or have exceptional experience in a professional field that fits the mission of the Institute. The visiting professor must demonstrate outstanding teaching ability to the satisfaction of the Dean of Teaching, Learning, and Faculty Development. Visiting professors are recruited by the administration in consultation with current faculty and are evaluated by the administration. Visiting professors are normally appointed for one- to three-year terms, after which they may be considered, through the regular recruitment and appointment process, for a regular faculty position. Continuing single-year appointments of visiting professors are strongly discouraged.

Visiting faculty on single-year contracts are not eligible to apply for sabbatical or faculty development grants, are not required to contribute service, and are not eligible to vote in the Faculty Assembly. Visiting faculty on a multi-year contract will be eligible to apply for faculty development grants. Visiting faculty on multi-year contracts will be eligible to vote in the Faculty Assembly and may serve on APSIC or other ad-hoc governance committees

ii. **Adjunct professors** are appointed on an _ad hoc_ basis to teach specific course(s) for which they have special expertise. For appointment as an Adjunct professor, a candidate normally must have earned a doctorate, or the highest degree available in the candidate’s field of specialization, or have exceptional experience in a professional field that fits the mission of the Institute. Adjunct professors are recruited and appointed on a semester-to-semester basis by the administration in consultation with the relevant program chair(s). They must demonstrate outstanding teaching ability in order to be re-appointed. Adjunct professors are evaluated by the administration. Adjunct professors are not eligible to apply for sabbatical or faculty development grants, and are not required to contribute service to the Institute.

iii. **Research professors** are members of the staff, not of the faculty. They are appointed to and employed by a research center because of the distinctive contribution they can make to the research program of the Institute. They should have academic and/or professional qualifications comparable to those of faculty. Research professors enjoy staff status, but not regular faculty prerogatives such as voting privileges in the Faculty Assembly. The allowable or required level of participation in school faculty affairs shall be decided by the administration in consultation with the regular faculty.

iv. **Professors emeritae/i** are faculty members who have, to the satisfaction of the regular faculty and VPAA, demonstrated excellence in teaching during their employment at MIIS, maintained professional stature in their field, and made significant contributions to the Institute. To be eligible for emerita/us status, a faculty member must normally meet the following additional criteria: (a) a minimum of ten years full-time service (or equivalent) at the Institute; (b) a desire and intent, expressed in person or in writing to the Faculty Senate, to maintain contact with the Institute; and (c) confirmation, again expressed in person or in writing to the Faculty Senate, that the candidate will not take a full-time, long-term teaching position at another university after retiring from MIIS. A retiring faculty member is normally nominated for emerita/us status by one or more current faculty members; this nomination is submitted to the Faculty Senate. Once the Faculty Senate is satisfied that the criteria are met, the nomination is presented to the Faculty Assembly for approval. The recommendation then proceeds to the VPAA for final approval. Professors emeritae/i enjoy certain privileges including, but not limited to, library and parking privileges, access to a computer and free use of the Internet. Professors emeritae/i are not eligible to apply for sabbatical or faculty development grants, do not vote, and are not expected to contribute service to the Institute.

v. **Instructors in Non-degree Programs** are appointed to teach in specific non-degree programs for which they have relevant qualifications, experience and expertise. For appointment as an Instructor, a candidate must normally hold a Master’s degree and have a minimum of two years experience in the relevant field of specialization. Instructors are appointed to an up to three-year, renewable contract and are evaluated by the program supervisor. Instructors are not eligible to apply for sabbatical leave and are not required to, but have the option to, serve on ad-hoc faculty committees.  Instructors are not eligible to vote in the faculty Assembly.  Instructors in non-degree programs with a multi-year contract may be eligible for competitive faculty professional development funding, if they can demonstrate clearly how the development will benefit the Institute.

**C.5.c. Faculty Rights and Responsibilities**

**Quality in teaching** is the first and most important responsibility of all Middlebury Institute faculty. Criteria for assessing if there is high teaching quality and other faculty responsibilities are described under Section 6 (Evaluation of the Faculty). Consistent with Institute policies, school faculty govern their school's academic programs and curriculum. Each school's faculty has the responsibility to organize itself for this purpose in a manner appropriate to the needs of the school’s professional graduate education.

Faculty have **teaching autonomy**, including evaluation of student work, selection of teaching methods, selection of material to be presented, and maintenance of a class atmosphere conducive to learning, all subject to the policies of the Institute.

The Institute encourages a close relationship between teacher and student in the learning process. Overall responsibility for **academic advising** rests with the dean of advising, career and student services, but the school deans and their faculties are expected to play an important role as collaborators in this vital function. Faculty are expected to advise students in terms of the relevant academic disciplines and the students’ chosen areas of specific focus. Students who require non-academic counseling should be referred to the director of student affairs, who is responsible for student welfare in the areas of housing, referral services, international student advisement, and other personal counseling as appropriate.

Regular faculty members are expected to participate meaningfully in events and activities that are essential to the Institute, the graduate schools, and the degree programs. These include, but are not limited to orientation, registration, convocation, commencement, committee work, and library development, as assigned.

Faculty members shall submit grades and other reports prior to established deadlines.

All faculty members are expected to hold regularly scheduled **office hours** each week, because these are deemed to be necessary to uphold their instructional and advising obligations. As a courtesy to students and others, faculty members should post notice of their office hours and inform the appropriate school dean's assistant(s) of their schedules each academic term. Faculty are expected to accommodate reasonable requests from students with scheduling conflicts for appointments outside regular office hours.

Regular faculty members with full-time appointments are expected to confine their **outside consultancies and non-Institute professional activities** to the equivalent of one (1) day a week during the academic year. They also may teach one course or its equivalent per term at another institution. Full-time faculty members who wish to teach for another institution must first obtain the consent of both the appropriate school dean and the VPAA. They may not teach any course that is, in the judgment of the dean and VPAA, in conflict with the interests of the Institute or in direct competition with the activities of the Institute.

Faculty appointments for the academic year normally do not include commitments to **summer teaching**. However, with the approval of her/his dean, a faculty member may teach during the summer term in lieu of equivalent teaching in one of the semesters of the regular academic year. Should a faculty member wish to teach during the summer in addition to teaching during regular terms, she/he may do so at salary and/or under other terms as agreed with his/her dean. Should any faculty member wish to teach or consult elsewhere during the summer, she/he may not teach any course that is, in the judgment of the dean and VPAA, in conflict with the interests of the Institute or in direct competition with the activities of the Institute, and she/he must provide advance notice as outlined above. Regular faculty in the relevant school should be consulted, if possible, before adjunct or visiting faculty are hired for summer teaching.

Faculty are expected to **conduct their research with integrity** and in line with standards of ethics that are commonly accepted within the academic community for proposing, conducting, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results. For the purpose of this document, we consider the term "research" to encompass both research and scholarship. Research misconduct means falsification, fabrication, plagiarism, retaliation of any kind against a person who in good faith reported or provided information about possible misconduct, or other actions that seriously deviate from commonly accepted standards of ethics. It does not include honest error or honest differences in interpretations or judgments of data. See Middlebury Policy [I.G. Misconduct in Research and Other Scholarly Activities](https://handbook.middlebury.edu/pages/i-policies-for-all/g-misconduct-in-research/) for more information regarding research misconduct.

Research involving **human and animal subjects** must first be reviewed by the Middlebury Institutional Review Board or [Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee](https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/resources/iacuc). The IRB includes several representatives from MIIS. The committee's procedures and forms are available at [https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/resources/irb](https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/resources/irb). Further information may be obtained from the MIIS VPAA.

Faculty **make recommendations regarding the awarding of degrees**, in accordance with the Institute’s degree requirements. All earned academic degrees are conferred by the VPAA of the Middlebury Institute upon recommendation of the faculty and approval of the Institute Board of Advisors and the Middlebury Board of Trustees.

The honorary degree awarded by the Institute is the Doctor of Humane Letters, _Honoris Causa_. It is awarded to individuals who meet at least one of the following qualifications:

*   conspicuous contributions to international affairs;
*   conspicuous contributions to education and/or scholarship;
*   conspicuous contributions to the Institute.

Faculty members may **propose candidates for honorary degrees** to the Faculty Senate for recommendation to the VPAA and the president of Middlebury.
