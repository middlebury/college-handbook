**Respect for Persons**   
All students, as members of the Middlebury community, are expected to respect the dignity, freedom, and rights of others. Behavior that violates common standards of decency, fails to comply with local laws or statutes, or demonstrates contempt for the generally accepted values of the intellectual community is prohibited. 

**Communicating With Honesty and Integrity**   
Middlebury’s General Conduct Standards and [Middlebury-Wide Policies](https://www.middlebury.edu/handbook/pages/i-policies-for-all)  include acting with integrity and honesty in all actions and communications relating to Middlebury. Therefore, providing information to any member of the Middlebury staff or faculty that an individual knows or reasonably should know is false or misleading is a serious violation of Middlebury policy. 

**Respect for Middlebury’s Educational Function**   
Any substantial disruption of Middlebury’s educational function is prohibited. 

**Respect for the Authority of Middlebury Officials**   
Middlebury depends on employees and agents to advance the educational mission of the institution. All students are expected to respect the authority of these individuals when they are executing their responsibilities for Middlebury. Students are expected to cooperate fully in the disciplinary process and any student, whether a party or a witness, who refuses to cooperate may be subject to discipline. Failure to comply with requests from Middlebury officials will subject a student to disciplinary sanctions.  

**Respect for Middlebury’s Resources**   
Middlebury’s educational mission depends on careful stewardship of our shared resources. Theft or intentional damage to resources (such as hacking, cybersecurity attacks, etc.) are prohibited. Unauthorized use of services and disposition of property to another under the pretense that it is one's own, are forms of theft. When such theft or damage constitutes a criminal offense, it will ordinarily be reported to law enforcement authorities.
