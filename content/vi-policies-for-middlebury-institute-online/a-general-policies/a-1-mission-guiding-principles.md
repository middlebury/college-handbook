This section of the Middlebury Handbook governs online courses and programs offered by Middlebury Institute Online. These policies are designed to ensure that Middlebury Institute Online’s programs align with Middlebury’s mission by nurturing immersive student learning; fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion to produce academic excellence; and supporting professional development of faculty and staff. The Middlebury Institute Online’s education is supported by the same three pillars that govern all of Middlebury: academic freedom, integrity, and respect.

Benefiting from our global network of educational programs and opportunities and strengths in the study of languages, cultures, and global issues, Middlebury students are uniquely situated to address the world’s most challenging problems. Online education strengthens those opportunities, allowing students in almost any location to learn from professionals in the field as well as expert faculty at other Middlebury locations. Online education also enables faculty at different locations to teach courses. Online education, as a complement to our in-person offerings, expands opportunities for students, fosters faculty collaboration, and strengthens us as an institution.
