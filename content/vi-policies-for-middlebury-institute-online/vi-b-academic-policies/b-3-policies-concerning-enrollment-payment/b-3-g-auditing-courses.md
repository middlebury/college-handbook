Requests to audit a course must be approved by the instructor of record and the student must register as an auditor, on a space available basis. Students registering to audit a Middlebury Institute Online course must pay half of the tuition rate for that course.  

The instructor of record establishes the requirements and required deliverables for auditing a course and has the right to refuse auditors. No credit is awarded for courses that are audited. The student’s record shows an AU for audit if the student has met the instructor’s attendance and deliverable requirements for awarding an AU. If the student fails to meet the instructor’s requirements, the instructor of record so informs the Records Office and no record of the course appears on the student’s transcript.
