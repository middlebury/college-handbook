A student may change their degree program to another program within Middlebury Institute Online or to an in-person program at the Middlebury Institute. The process for changing degree programs includes the following steps: 

*   The student discusses the matter with their academic advisor, including eligibility and possible implications for degree requirements and degree completion. 
*   The advisor directs the student to the appropriate procedure, depending on the student’s current and future programs. Some changes of degree program require a new application through the admission office. 
*   Once a change of program has been completed and approved by all relevant parties, the advisor works with the student to develop a new plan of study for the new degree.
