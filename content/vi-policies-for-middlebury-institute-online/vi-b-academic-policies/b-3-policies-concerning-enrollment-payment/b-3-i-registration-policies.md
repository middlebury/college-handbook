title: B.3.i. Registration Policies for Non-Degree Students
date: 2024-08-23
---
Non-degree students may register for up to six (6) credits per term, with approval of the Program Director and the instructor, if space is available in those courses. Any exceptions to this limit must be approved by the Dean of Middlebury Institute Online. Enrollment priority for for-credit courses goes to degree-seeking students.  

Credit earned while attending Middlebury Institute Online as a non-degree student may be applied later to a degree or certificate program at the Middlebury Institute Online, if the credit for that course is applied to a relevant/eligible degree program within 5 years from when the student takes the course. 

Non-degree students who wish to change to degree or certificate status must reapply through the Admissions Office at least one month in advance of the term in which the change is to become effective. All requirements for admission to degree programs in effect at that time must be met. No application fee is required if the application fee was paid initially.
