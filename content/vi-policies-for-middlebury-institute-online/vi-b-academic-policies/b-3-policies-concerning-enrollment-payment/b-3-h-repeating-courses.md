Normally, students enrolled in the Middlebury Institute Online are not permitted to repeat a course for which they have earned credit and a passing grade. However, in rare cases, a student may be granted permission by the Dean to repeat a course by registering for the course again and paying the appropriate tuition. When a student repeats a course, the grade recorded the first time the course was completed remains permanently on the student’s transcript. However, only the new grade will be considered in the calculation of the student’s Grade Point Average.
