title: B.3.d. Adding or Dropping Courses
date: 2024-08-23
---
Course registration deadlines for adding and dropping courses are published by the Office of the Registrar. All additions to a student’s schedule must be made in BannerWeb before the published Add deadline. Courses may be added through the 10th business day of the academic session. Adding courses will result in additional tuition charges. 

Enrolled students will be automatically added to the course site after it is created by the instructor. Students will be able to access it once it is published by the instructor.  

Students who wish to drop or withdraw from a course are solely responsible for doing so prior to any relevant drop deadlines. Note: Without an official drop, tuition charges for the course remain due and payable. No record is kept of a course(s) that is dropped by 4 PM PT on the 10th business day of the academic session. No course(s) may be dropped after the 10th business day of a regular session, except when illness or other emergency requires a leave of absence or withdrawal from the Institute. Withdrawing from a course after the published deadline requires a petition for waiver of academic regulations. If granted, a “W” grade, which does not affect the GPA, will be recorded and tuition will remain due and payable. 

Middlebury Institute Online requires students to demonstrate course participation in the first week (Monday - Sunday) of an online course. After the first week of the course, Student Financial Services initiates the enrollment verification process to disburse financial aid. If a student does not participate before enrollment verification is initiated, the student will be administratively removed from their course(s) and their financial aid adjusted accordingly.  

Academic participation includes any point-earning activity in a class, including but not limited to posting to a discussion board, submitting an assignment, student-initiated contact with a faculty member to ask a question about a course topic, or submitting an exam or quiz. Activities that do not constitute academic participation include logging in to the Learning Management System, emailing the professor about grades, submitting a video introduction, discussing academic progress in the course or program, and communicating via email with an advisor, student financial services, or other administrative staff.
