Tuition for Middlebury Institute Online courses is due on the first day of the term for both sessions in a term (e.g., spring session A and spring session B), unless you have made payment arrangements with the Student Financial Services office. Any delinquent account not satisfied by the 10th business day of the term may be assessed a late payment fee of $250. Middlebury Institute Online reserves the right to revoke the registration for a course or the program for non-payment. If registration for the course or program is revoked, the student will not be permitted to continue the course and will not receive a grade. 

All registration for courses or programs at the Middlebury Institute Online are subject to subsequent revocation by the Middlebury Institute Online in its sole discretion, and at any time that the Institute determines that a student account has an outstanding balance. If the Middlebury Institute Online thus revokes registration for a course or program, the student may not further attend those courses, nor may the student earn grades.  Any outstanding tuition balance from previous terms must be paid in full before a student is eligible to register. 

Any credit card payment made to a student account in excess of the balance (less anticipated financial aid) will be refunded to the credit card utilized for payment.
