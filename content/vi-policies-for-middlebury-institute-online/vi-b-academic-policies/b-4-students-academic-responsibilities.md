Students are expected to log in to their courses regularly, participate and interact with other students and instructors, and complete course work on time. All courses that offer credit through Middlebury Institute Online are thoughtfully designed to foster interaction between students, and between students and instructors, grounded in our identity as an institution that prioritizes interpersonal engagement. Together, instructors and students collaborate to build inclusive learning environments that allow all students to thrive.Â  Failure to participate in course activities may result in a student being administratively withdrawn from a course, per section B.3.d. of this handbook.
