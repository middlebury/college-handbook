title: B.5.e. Academic Standing

---
A student’s academic standing is calculated at the end of each term. All students are required to maintain an overall 3.00 grade point average in all course work completed at the Middlebury Institute Online. 

**Satisfactory Academic Progress** 

A student is making **Satisfactory Academic Progress** when a cumulative and term grade point average of 3.00 is maintained each term **and** the Institute determines that the following conditions are met: 

*   No grade of C or lower has been received in any course taken that term;
*   No more than two Incomplete grades appear on the student’s record.

Students whom the Institute determines are not making satisfactory academic progress are required to achieve this status by the end of the next term in which the student is enrolled at the Middlebury Institute Online. Please note that Satisfactory Academic Progress standards for federal financial aid may differ from Middlebury Institute Online policy. Please [consult the Student Financial Services website](https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/admissions/financial-aid/policies#satisfactory-academic-progress) for more information.
