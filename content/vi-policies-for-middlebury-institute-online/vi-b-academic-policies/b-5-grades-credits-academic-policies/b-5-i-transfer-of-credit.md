title: B.5.i. Transfer of Credit From Other Institutions
date: 10/29/2024
---
After being admitted to the Middlebury Institute Online, a student may petition the Dean (who will consult with the relevant Program Director) to consider courses taken elsewhere at accredited institutions for satisfaction of specific Institute degree requirements. Transfer credit is limited to a maximum of 25 percent of graduate degree requirements for courses requiring more than 30 credits. 

Courses counted towards a previous Bachelor’s or Master’s degree cannot be transferred to the Middlebury Institute Online for credit. Proposed transfer graduate courses must meet the Institute’s degree requirements, and the student must have earned a grade of B or better.  

Grades assigned by other institutions for courses that are transferred to the Middlebury Institute Online are not calculated in the Middlebury Institute Online grade point average.
