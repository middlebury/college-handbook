The following system of grading is used at the Middlebury Institute Online: 

<table><tbody><tr><td>A and A+&nbsp;</td><td>4.00 grade points per credit&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>A- (minus)&nbsp;</td><td>3.67&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>B+ (plus)&nbsp;</td><td>3.33&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>B&nbsp;</td><td>3.00&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>B-&nbsp;</td><td>2.67&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>C+&nbsp;</td><td>2.33&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>C&nbsp;</td><td>2.00&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>C-&nbsp;</td><td>1.67&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>D+&nbsp;</td><td>1.33&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>D&nbsp;</td><td>1.00&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>D-&nbsp;</td><td>0.67&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>F (Fail)&nbsp;</td><td>0.00&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>P (Pass)&nbsp;</td><td>Credit for course, no grade points&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>NP (No Pass)&nbsp;</td><td>No grade points or credit&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>I (Incomplete)&nbsp;</td><td>No grade points or credit&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>W (Withdrawal with permission)&nbsp;</td><td>No grade points or credit&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>AU (Audit)&nbsp;</td><td>No grade points or credit&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>

No other grading may be used. 

Except for grades of “I” all grades are considered final when reported by a faculty member at the end of a session or marking period. A change of grade may be requested **only** when a calculation, clerical, administrative, or recording error is discovered in the original assignment of a course grade or when a decision is made to change the grade as a result of the disputed academic evaluation procedure. Grade changes necessitated by a calculation, clerical, administrative, or recording error must be reported within a period of six months from the time the grade is awarded. **No grade may be changed as the result of a re-evaluation of a student’s work or the submission of supplemental work** following the close of a session.  

Requests for grade changes should be submitted to the Middlebury Institute’s Associate Dean of Academic Operations, who shall first verify that the Change of Grade request satisfies established criteria, and then refer acceptable requests to the Records Office.
