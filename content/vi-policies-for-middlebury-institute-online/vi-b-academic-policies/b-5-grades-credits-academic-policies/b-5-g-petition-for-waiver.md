title: B.5.h. Petition for Waiver of Academic Requirements
date: 10/29/2024
---
Students who wish to be considered for a waiver of any academic policy or requirement for any degree program should complete and submit a Petition for Waiver of Academic Regulations from the Records Office. 

The student should specify on the Petition which academic policy or requirement they wish to waive, and why the waiver is necessary and justified. Additional documentation may be submitted with the form which supports the request. 

Signatures of support must be obtained on the Petition from the Program Director. In cases where tuition is involved, the Office of Student Financial Services must also sign the Petition. Once all relevant signatures are obtained, the student should submit the form to the Dean of Middlebury Institute Online. The Records Office shall advise students as to which signatures are required. 

The Dean of Middlebury Institute Online will determine whether the petition for waiver will be granted or denied. If granted, the waiver must be applied to the student’s record by the Records Office before the waiver becomes official. **Note:** if a requirement is waived, the total number of credits required for graduation in each program is not affected by the waiver, i.e. credit is not given for courses that are waived.
