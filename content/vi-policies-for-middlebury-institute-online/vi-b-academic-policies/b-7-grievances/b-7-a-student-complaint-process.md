title: B.7.a. Student Complaint Process
date: 2024-08-23
---
Prior to any formal complaint, students are encouraged to seek an informal resolution of their complaint directly with the employee, faculty, and/or individuals involved. Often a problem may be resolved in this informal manner. In the unfortunate event that a resolution is not achieved, students may follow Middlebury’s complaint filing process.  

If the issue is not satisfactorily resolved internally, and the student seeks additional resolution, grievances regarding online education may be appealed to either the student’s home state agency or the Vermont agency. Please use [this resource](http://nc-sara.org/content/state-portal-agency-contacts) to locate each state’s contact agency.
