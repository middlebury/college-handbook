If a student is suspected of plagiarism, cheating, or duplicate use of written work, an instructor or program administrator should escalate to the Associate Dean of Academic Operations for the Middlebury Institute, who will determine appropriate next steps for resolution or escalation. This escalation may involve referral to the Associate Dean of Student Services/Human Relations Officer and the Conduct Judicial Board.
