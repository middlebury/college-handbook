title: B.1.b. Student Responsibilities for their Academic Work
date: 2024-08-23
---
Graded assignments should be the work of the individual student, unless otherwise directed by the professor. Students must assume responsibility for their own integrity on all assigned academic work. 

The individual student is responsible for ensuring that their work does not involve plagiarism. Ignorance of the nature of plagiarism or of Middlebury Institute Online’s policies may not be offered as a mitigating circumstance. 

Students are required to consult with their instructor if they have doubts about the ethics or practices of citations, collaborative projects, utilizing their own prior work, use of artificial intelligence (AI) or generative AI tools, or any other questions related to academic integrity. Any use of generative AI tools that is not expressly permitted or approved by an instructor may be considered cheating and/or plagiarism.
