If students experience a short-term inability to engage with the course (mild illness, power outage, etc.), they are expected to contact their instructor as soon as possible to request arrangements to make up any missed work. If students are unable to engage with the course for more than a week, they should contact their instructor to discuss whether or not it will be possible to catch up. Depending on the circumstances, a withdrawal, a grade of incomplete, or a leave of absence may be warranted. The student should reach out to their academic advisor and Program Director to discuss. Students should review the refund policies and deadlines for Middlebury Institute Online courses. Students who do notÂ  participate and fail to communicate appropriately with their instructor and/or advisor may be removed from a course and/or assigned a failing grade, without refund of tuition.
