Each degree candidate must file a petition for graduation with the Records Office at the beginning of their final term at the Middlebury Institute Online. **Note:** it is the responsibility of students to consult with their academic advisor well in advance of the intended date of graduation to ensure that they are on track to meet the requirements for their degrees. 

Degree Audit: After a student has applied for graduation, their academic record is evaluated by the Records Office to ensure that the courses required for the degree have been successfully completed and the overall GPA is 3.00 or better. If the student’s course work does not meet the requirements of the degree, the Records Office will notify the student and a degree will not be conferred until all requirements are completed satisfactorily. 

A student will not be permitted to graduate from or otherwise be deemed to have officially completed a Middlebury Institute Online program in which they are enrolled while a disciplinary matter is pending; the student’s graduation or certification may be held in abeyance until the matter is resolved.
