title: B.6.c. Leave of Absence - Student Initiated
date: 2024-08-23
---
A student may request a leave of absence after they have successfully completed at least one session with the Middlebury Institute Online, is in good academic standing, and has met all financial obligations to Middlebury Institute Online. A leave of absence is approved for up to one year; in rare circumstances, a leave of absence may, at the student’s request, be extended for a second year.   

The student must submit a [Leave of Absence petition](https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/sites/www.middlebury.edu.institute/files/2019-09/leave_of_absence_petition--eFillable.pdf?fv=TsilFBL8) and a non-refundable deposit of $150 must be paid by 4 PM Pacific Time on the third day of the first session of absence. The deposit is applicable toward the student’s tuition upon returning to the Middlebury Institute Online. Unless this procedure is followed, a returning student must apply for readmission through the Admissions Office. 

**Students should be aware that, because they are not enrolled during a leave of absence, student loan payments may become due.** Students receiving any federal financial aid should obtain advice and instructions on leaves of absence from the Office of Student Financial Services and schedule an exit interview, which is required by federal regulations. 

Upon return from a leave of absence, the student must have no outstanding balance due and have a $150 non-refundable deposit on account. The $150 tuition deposit will be applied against billed tuition in the returning term. The deposit is good for a maximum of two years, after which the student must re-apply for admission to Middlebury Institute Online. **Note:** No student will be allowed to register if there is a balance due on their tuition account.
