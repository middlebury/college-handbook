If the instructor has brief planned travel, e.g., to a professional conference, the instructor is expected to be in communication with students about any change to office hours or response times to emails. If the instructor is unavailable for longer (illness, family emergency, etc.) they are required to contact their Program Director to develop a plan for course continuity.  

In the event that an instructor departs or stops fulfilling professional responsibilities shortly before the course start date or during the course, Middlebury Institute Online will take necessary steps to complete the course offering, including use of the course site and course materials as well as assigning another instructor to take over the course. Students with concerns about an instructor’s availability should contact their program director or the Dean of Middlebury Institute Online.
