Students who withdraw after the start of the program may receive a reduction of the billed charges according to the table below, less any non-recoverable expenses (payments made or due on behalf of the student), provided that written notification of withdrawal is received by Middlebury within the indicated time frame. All programs are considered to start on the first day of orientation for fall or spring-only students, and again on the first day of spring classes for academic year students. Students who are dismissed from the program are not eligible for a refund.

**Middlebury students (undergraduates and graduates):**

Students whose withdrawal results in a reduction of the billed charges will have the College charges and their financial aid adjusted based on the amount of time they were enrolled according to both Middlebury and federal formulas.

Students who have received any financial aid or scholarships should contact Student Financial Services at sfs@middlebury.edu or 802-443-5158 to obtain information on how a withdrawal may affect their financial aid and student account balance.

If adjustments to billed charges and financial aid create a credit balance on your account, you may receive a refund payment for the amount of the credit balance through your student account with Nelnet Campus Commerce.

**Students from other colleges and universities:**

For students from colleges or universities other than Middlebury whose home institution is paying Middlebury directly for all or any part of the billable charges, you will also be subject to any applicable refund policies of your home school.

If adjustments to billed charges create a credit balance, depending on billing arrangements with your home institution, you may receive a refund payment for the amount of the credit balance through your student account with Nelnet Campus Commerce.  Any credit balance on your institution’s account with Middlebury will be refunded to the institution.
