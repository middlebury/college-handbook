Students who are eligible for a refund will have the College charges and their financial aid (for Middlebury students) pro-rated based on the amount of time they were enrolled according to both Middlebury and federal formulas.

Students who have received any financial aid or scholarships should contact the Student Financial Services office at [sfs@middlebury.edu](mailto:sfs@middlebury.edu) or 802-443-5158 to obtain information on how a withdrawal may affect their financial aid and student account balance.

To the extent granted, refunds will be sent by check to the person or institution who paid the charges initially. If any authorized refund represents in whole or in part the proceeds of a student loan, remittance will be made by the College first to the lender or holder of the loan for the applicable part of the refund. In this event, the student will be given written notice of such disbursement made on their behalf out of the total proceeds of the refund.
