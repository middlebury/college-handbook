**Independent Project (500 Projects)**  
Undergraduates with advanced preparation and a superior record in their field may register for an independent project ("500") abroad. To do so, they should submit a letter from their department to International Programs at Middlebury College during the semester prior to studying abroad i.e., not upon or after arrival at the School Abroad. The letter should indicate the adviser’s (or department’s) readiness to assess and grade the project on the student’s return to the United States. Please note: An incomplete will appear on the student’s record until Middlebury College receives a grade from the adviser from the home institution.  The grade must be submitted by the beginning of the next semester. 

**Independent Study**  
Depending on the School Abroad, and with the approval of the director of the School Abroad, undergraduates with advanced preparation and a superior record in their field may be able to enroll in an independent study under the supervision of a faculty member on-site.
