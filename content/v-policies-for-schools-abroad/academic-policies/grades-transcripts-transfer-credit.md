title: C.2. Grades, Transcripts, and Transfer of Credit
date: 2022-02-17
---
The following grades are used: A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D, F. Since our host universities do not use the same system of credits and grades as U.S. institutions, students receive U.S. equivalent credits and grades as established by the appropriate School Abroad Director. Your country-specific Guide includes the relevant conversion chart for your School Abroad. 

Taking a course pass/fail is not an option at the Schools Abroad. 

Students from other institutions should be aware that while your home college or university may not indicate your grades earned abroad on your institution’s transcript, you will have a permanent academic record at Middlebury, and applications to graduate and professional schools require the submission of original transcripts from all institutions of higher education attended in the U.S. or abroad. 

When final grades become available, students will be able to access them online via BannerWeb.  Grades are never released over the phone. 

_a) Middlebury Students_ 

Grades are automatically recorded on the student’s Middlebury College transcript. You will be able to access your grades via BannerWeb as soon as you complete the study abroad evaluation. 

_b) Students From Other Colleges and Universities_ 

The normal course load for undergraduates is 4 or 5 courses per semester, depending on the school, equivalent to 16 or 15 credit hours, respectively, or 20-25 quarter hours. 

When you applied to the program, your study abroad advisor indicated to which address at your home institution your Middlebury transcript should be sent. Middlebury will send one copy of your transcript from your semester(s) abroad to this address for the purpose of credit transfer. If you are a post-bac student, Middlebury will send your transcript to your home address. Additional copies may be requested in writing and for a fee from the [Middlebury Registrar’s Office](https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/academic/records/transcripts). 

_c) Incompletes_ 

A grade of “Incomplete” must be approved by the Director of your School Abroad and will only be granted in cases of **extreme** necessity (i.e., documented medical or personal emergencies). There must be a clear understanding between the faculty member and the student as to the conditions under which the “Incomplete” is to be removed. Students who wish to petition for an “Incomplete” in a non-emergency situation are required to complete a special form available from the School Abroad’s office at least three weeks prior to their departure. All “Incompletes” must be made up one month prior to the end of the following semester, according to the School Abroad’s calendar. Be sure to allow sufficient time for the material to be received and graded by the appropriate professor before these dates. **Students are responsible for ensuring that the professor receives the material in a timely fashion.** Students should be sure to keep a copy for themselves. “Incompletes” not removed by the deadline mentioned above automatically become “F’s” on the student’s transcript. **It is the responsibility of the student to make sure that this deadline is respected—no warnings are sent by Middlebury to the student.** 

_d) Appealing Grades_ 

Students who wish to appeal a course grade should write to the relevant Director of the School Abroad, stating the reasons and submitting copies of all relevant supporting materials. Students should be aware, however, that appealing a course grade will cause a thorough review of the grade, which means that it is possible that the grade may actually be revised downward. Appeals must be made within six months of the grade being posted. Subsequent appeals may be made to the Dean of International Programs, whose decision is final.  

If a professor changes a grade as a result of intervention by the student, it will not be recognized by Middlebury. The only grade changes that are acceptable are those that result from going through the aforementioned process.
