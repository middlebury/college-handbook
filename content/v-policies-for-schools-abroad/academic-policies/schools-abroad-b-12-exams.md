Students are required to take all exams when and where they are designated even if students on other study abroad/exchange programs are allowed to opt out or rearrange exam schedules.  
Students do not have the option to take exams a second time; nor will they be allowed to have them proctored in the U.S. This means you are required to sit for exams at the same time and place as students in the host country. In many of our host countries, local students have multiple opportunities to take a final exam. Students enrolled in a School Abroad are not permitted to avail themselves of this option..
