Middlebury College undergraduate students who plan to use graduate-level course work taken at a School Abroad towards their undergraduate degree must let the Middlebury College Registrar’s Office know before the end of their semester/year abroad. A qualified student may accumulate a maximum of three graduate units toward a Middlebury M.A. degree before receipt of the B.A. degree, or equivalent.
Students from other colleges or universities should contact the Registrar’s Office at their home college or university _before_ taking any graduate-level courses abroad.
