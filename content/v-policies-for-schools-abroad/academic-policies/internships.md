Students may earn up to one class’s worth of credit, depending on the school, while attending a School Abroad.  This credit will be assessed as a letter grade. Students from other institutions are eligible to take credit-bearing internships if their home school’s policies allow, or if they do not need that credit to transfer.  **Not all U.S. institutions grant academic credit for internships.** It is the student’s responsibility to confirm with their home institution that they are eligible to receive credit for an internship prior to arriving in-country.  Volunteer opportunities are available for students who do not wish to pursue credit-bearing internships, but who do wish to gain work experience abroad. Only students who attend two different Schools Abroad (in two different countries) may, potentially, do two internships for credit during their time at the Middlebury Schools Abroad. 

_Internships are not guaranteed for any participant_. They are granted on a competitive basis and subject to the agreement of the School Abroad and the prospective employer. Placements are dependent on availability and the previous experience, qualifications, and language ability of each student.  Interns need to dress appropriately for their work environment, thus those working in offices will need to pack dress clothes. 

Students who pursue internships are expected to follow through with their commitment until the end of the semester. Students who fail to do so after the on-site registration period will earn an “F” and will be ineligible to enroll in another course. 

Paid internships may not receive credit.
