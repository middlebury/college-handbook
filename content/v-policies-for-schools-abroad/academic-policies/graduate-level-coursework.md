Middlebury College students who plan to use graduate-level course work taken at a School Abroad towards their undergraduate degree must let the Middlebury College Registrar’s Office know before the end of their semester/year abroad. A qualified student may accumulate a maximum of three graduate units toward a Middlebury M.A. degree before receipt of the B.A. degree, or equivalent. 

Students from other colleges or universities should contact the Registrar’s Office at their home college or university before taking any graduate-level courses abroad.
