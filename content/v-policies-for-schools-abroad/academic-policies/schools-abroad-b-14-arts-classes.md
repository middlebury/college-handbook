Students wishing to enroll in course work toward their major or minor in studio art, dance, or music must submit a letter from their academic advisor to International Programs the semester prior to going abroad confirming they have reached a level of performance sufficient to make semi-independent work in the foreign context both feasible and profitable and indicating the number of contact hours required to obtain one unit of credit (three semester hours).

Every effort will be made to find an appropriate course for the student but it is not always possible. Fees incurred will normally be covered up to the number of hours required for one unit of credit. The program does not cover the cost of lessons or work that is not pre-approved for credit by the studentâ€™s advisor or department chair.
