Students are not permitted to make private arrangements for submission of required work or completion of exams with individual instructors. Students engaging in such activities will have their final grades reduced. 

Early submission of coursework is not an excuse to leave early, nor should work be submitted after the deadline established by the instructor. In case of illness, students are advised to seek medical advice promptly, so as to avoid complications. It is the student’s responsibility to keep the School informed of their progress by personally telephoning the office staff, to present a medical certificate, and to make up work missed after consulting with the instructor. Failure to adhere to these regulations may result in a lower grade or failure in the course. 

_Visits by parents, relatives, or friends do not constitute a valid excuse for not completing assignments on time._
