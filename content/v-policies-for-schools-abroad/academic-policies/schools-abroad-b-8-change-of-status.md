All requests by Middlebury undergraduates for changes in their enrollment status in a School Abroad must be submitted no later than October 15/June 1 on a Change of Status Form, signed by the Director/Principal of your School Abroad, to International Programs (IPOCS), who will then advise the Registrar and any other office. This includes requests from students enrolled in a School Abroad for the full year who wish to return to Middlebury for the spring semester, requests from students enrolled in a School Abroad for the calendar year who wish to return to Middlebury for the fall semester, requests from students enrolled in a School Abroad for the fall semester who wish to extend their stay to the full academic year or to transfer to another Middlebury School Abroad and requests from students enrolled in a School Abroad for the spring semester who wish to extend their stay to the full calendar year or to transfer to another Middlebury School Abroad. A student enrolled for the full year who wishes to return to Middlebury after the fall semester will be admitted for winter term or spring semester (whichever will be their first semester on campus after the end of their academic program abroad) if they advise IPOCS by the October 15 deadline. After the October 15 deadline, IPOCS staff will email the Residential Systems Coordinator to put the student on a waiting list for either a winter term or a spring semester return to Middlebury. A student enrolled for the calendar year who wishes to return to Middlebury after the spring semester will be admitted for fall semester if they advise IPOCS by the June 1 deadline. After the October 15/June 1 deadline, IPOCS staff will email the Residential Systems Coordinator to put the student on a waiting list for a return to Middlebury.  
 

The College and the Schools Abroad may not be able to accommodate requests for changes in status submitted after the October 15/June 1 deadline, in which case a student who wishes not to remain abroad would be required to withdraw from the College for the remainder of the year.
