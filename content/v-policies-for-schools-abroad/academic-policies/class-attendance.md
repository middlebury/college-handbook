Attendance is required throughout your courses, with travel or other absences reserved for weekends and official holidays. Regular or repeated absences without a medical excuse or similar extenuating circumstances are considered unexcused absences and may result in course warnings and will ultimately affect the final grade. When disruptive to the program, this can result in the student’s dismissal from the school. 

_Visits by parents, relatives, or friends do not constitute a valid excuse for not attending classes._
