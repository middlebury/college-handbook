Students should refer to the academic calendar for specific add/drop dates. Permission of the Director/Principal of your School Abroad is required in all cases.  
 

Students who are dismissed or who voluntarily withdraw after the on-site registration period and before the last week of classes will receive a grade of “WD.” Students who are dismissed or who voluntarily withdraw during the last week of classes or after will receive a grade of “F” in all of their courses. More information about the Schools Abroad withdrawal policy may be found [here](https://staging--college-handbook.netlify.app/handbook/pages/v-policies-for-schools-abroad/academic-policies/schools-abroad-b-9-withdrawals).  
 

In exceptional circumstances, and when indicated by a medical or health care professional, students may request to withdraw from one (and only one) course, rather than withdraw entirely from the program. If granted by the Director/Principal of the School Abroad, the student receives a WD on their transcript.
