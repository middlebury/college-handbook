**Training and Education**

Prior to departure, all Schools Abroad students are required to complete live and/or online training programs regarding sexual violence primary prevention and response, which includes: bystander intervention and risk reduction, information about Middlebury's policies and procedures, definitions of prohibited behaviors, reporting, confidentiality, Middlebury's Title IX Coordinator and designees, resources, prevalence, and other related information.

**Program Testing**

Students at the Middlebury Schools Abroad will be tested on their language competence (where applicable) both upon arrival and prior to departure (year-long students may be tested at the mid-point as well).

**Studying Another Language in the Target Language**

Students are not permitted to start a new language while enrolled at a School Abroad. When academically justified, and when clearly related to a student's academic plans and interests, or if the language is related to the target language, a single course in another language may be taken for credit per semester. **Students should be prepared to be evaluated upon their return to their home institution to determine if they are eligible to advance to the next level.** In cases with no academic rationale, credit will not be granted. In these cases, students may make private arrangements to continue the language at their own expense.
