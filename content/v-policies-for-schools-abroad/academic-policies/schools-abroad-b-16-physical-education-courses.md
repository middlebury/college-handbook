Middlebury undergraduate students are required to complete two physical education courses prior to graduation.  They may fulfill one or both of these requirements abroad by participating in an approved physical education course.  Students should consult Middlebury physical education department ([pe@middlebury.edu](mailto:pe@middlebury.edu)) to seek approval for these courses.
