title: B.4. Cancellation Fees
date: 2021-12-17

The cancellation policy applies to any student who commits to the program abroad, but then decides not to attend prior to the start of the program.  All programs are considered to start on the first day of orientation for fall or spring-only students, and again on the first day of spring classes for academic year students.  If a student chooses, for any reason, to cancel their commitment to the program prior to the published arrival date, Middlebury reserves the right to charge the student according to the Cancellation Fee Schedule below. In addition, at the time of cancellation, Middlebury will calculate the total amount of non-recoverable costs incurred on the student’s behalf. If the total amount of these non-recoverable costs is greater than the appropriate cancellation fee noted in the Cancellation Fee Schedule, Middlebury will charge the student the total amount of non-recoverable costs. 

Academic year students who withdraw for the spring semester prior to the start of the second semester will forfeit any non-recoverable costs for the spring semester but will not incur a separate cancellation fee. These non-recoverable costs cannot be calculated until receipt of written notification.
