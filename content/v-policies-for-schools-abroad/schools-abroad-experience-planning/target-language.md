title: B.3. Studying Another Language in the Target Language
date: 2021-12-17

Students are not permitted to start a new language while enrolled at a School Abroad. When academically justified, and when clearly related to a studentâ€™s academic plans and interests, or if the language is related to the target language, a single course in another language may be taken for credit per semester. **Students should be prepared to be evaluated upon their return to their home institution to determine if they are eligible to advance to the next level.** In cases with no academic rationale, credit will not be granted. In these cases, students may make private arrangements to continue the language at their own expense.
