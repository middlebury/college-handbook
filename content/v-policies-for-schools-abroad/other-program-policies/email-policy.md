Middlebury students should continue to use their college email address (username@middlebury.edu).  Students from other colleges and universities are issued a Middlebury email address (username@middlebury.edu) upon enrollment in the program.  This Middlebury-issued email address will be used by Middlebury for official communication with students.  The College expects that such communications, many of which are time-sensitive, will be received and read.
