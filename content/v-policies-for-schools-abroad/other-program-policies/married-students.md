Students whose spouse travels overseas with them should be aware that they cannot expect assistance with visa applications for their spouses or other family members. Likewise, spouses and other family members are not permitted to join excursions or activities arranged by the School Abroad.  Students may elect to purchase health insurance through GeoBlue International Health Insurance for their spouse or children traveling abroad with them for the same period that they are enrolled (see [Health & Security Insurance](https://schoolsabroadhandbooks.middcreate.net/graduate/health/276-2/)).
