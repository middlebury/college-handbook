title: D.4. Bed Bug Policy
date: 2021-12-17

If a student or host/landlord believes bed bugs are present, they must notify the Schools Abroad Director promptly. Middlebury will ordinarily cover the cost of a first extermination treatment only if it is unclear whether the bed bugs were introduced by the students. The cost for subsequent treatment of the same room will be shared (50-50) by the student and the host/landlord. If it is clear at the outset that one or the other party is responsible for bringing in the bed bugs, that individual will be responsible.
