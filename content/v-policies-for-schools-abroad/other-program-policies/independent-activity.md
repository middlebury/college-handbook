Similar to most U.S. campuses, the School Abroad staff cannot be expected to be available to support students to manage health and safety incidents that occur during breaks (i.e. vacation breaks or between semesters).  During these breaks, students will still have access to the medical and emergency resources available through GeoBlue and Global Rescue.
