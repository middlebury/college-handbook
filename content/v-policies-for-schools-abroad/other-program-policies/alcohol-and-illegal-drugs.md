Involvement with or dependency upon drugs or excessive or illegal use of alcohol is viewed by Middlebury as a health concern, as well as a disciplinary matter. Many of the safety incidents that our students have experienced have occurred when the students were intoxicated. Schools Abroad students, faculty, staff and visitors must not only adhere to [Middlebury's policies of alcohol and drug use](/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/alcohol-drugs/#drugs), but abide by the laws and policies of the host country and institution.

Overseas authorities also consider illegal drug use to be an extremely serious matter. Local laws often impose severe penalties, including jail time, for conviction of drug possession, no matter what the quantity.  Moreover, it is not uncommon for the accused to be considered guilty until proven innocent and be held in jail. Middlebury College and U.S. officials will be powerless to help students found to be engaging in unlawful drug use or the selling or transporting of drugs.

Any time a Schools Abroad official has reasonable concerns that your health is being compromised by alcohol or other drug use (even in cases where no concrete evidence or direct witness is involved), a drug and/or alcohol consultation or assessment may be required.

In addition, the Schools Abroad official may notify your family and/or home institution regarding concerns about drug or alcohol use.
