A transcript for each student is kept in the [Middlebury College Registrar's office](http://www.middlebury.edu/offices/academic/records). The individual School offices in Middlebury and abroad also keep applications, correspondence, brief memoranda of conferences with students, and evaluations of students' work by instructors, when they judge that such information may be useful or necessary in giving continuing counsel. Please see the Middlebury Handbook for more information about the [Records Policy](https://www.middlebury.edu/handbook/pages/i-policies-for-all/records).
