## Introduction

All Schools Abroad students are subject to the Schools Abroad policies set forth below as well as the Middlebury-Wide Policies in the general Middlebury Handbook. When reviewing these policies, note that in the context of the Schools Abroad, “Middlebury staff” refers to the Director/Principal of the School Abroad. Students are also subject to the host university’s policies and rules (as applicable).

These policies may be amended from time to time and therefore students should review the most current online version for any updates. Any amendments as published on this website shall supersede wholly any prior versions of the policy(ies). Middlebury endeavors to present an accurate overview of the programs, facilities, and fees of the Schools Abroad in this handbook. However, Middlebury reserves the right to alter any program, facilities, or fees, described below or in other publications without notice or obligation.

Middlebury College has unrestricted right to use and publish photographs taken of participants while enrolled at the Middlebury College Schools Abroad. This includes photographs or videos, for editorial purposes, or any other official college purpose. This may include print, electronic, or any other media form.

Consistent with the cultivation of an awareness of responsibility and accountability, students found in violation of Middlebury’s policies as stated herein, the [Middlebury-Wide Policies](https://www.middlebury.edu/handbook/pages/i-policies-for-all) in the Middlebury Handbook, or the host university’s policies and/or who participate in prohibited acts as defined herein will be held responsible and will be subject to discipline up to and including suspension or expulsion from the School Abroad. In addition, students may be subject to discipline by any Middlebury program in which the student is or will be enrolled or their home institution.
