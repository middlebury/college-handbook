title: A.1. Community Standards
---

The ability of Middlebury to achieve its purposes depends on members of the campus community upholding our commonly accepted standards of conduct, which enable the highest quality of teaching and learning. Broadly, these are referred to as our Community Standards. Middlebury seeks to prepare students to be active citizens and leaders who will address the world’s most pressing problems. This mission is advanced through students’ experiences with successes and challenges, and is reflected in the following Community Standards:

* cultivating respect and responsibility for self, others, and our shared environment; 
* encouraging personal and intellectual courage and growth;
* manifesting integrity and honesty in all decisions and actions;
* promoting healthy, safe and balanced lifestyles; and, 
* fostering a diverse and inclusive community committed to civility, open-mindedness and finding common ground. 

Therefore, a balance of individual and community health and growth guides Middlebury’s approach to all endeavors, and to the policies that support those endeavors. 

Consistent with the cultivation of an awareness of responsibility and accountability, students found in violation of Middlebury’s policies as stated herein, the  [Middlebury-Wide Policies](https://www.middlebury.edu/handbook/pages/i-policies-for-all/) in the Middlebury Handbook, or the host university’s policies and/or who participate in prohibited acts as defined herein will be held responsible and will be subject to discipline up to and including suspension or expulsion from the School Abroad. In addition, students may be subject to discipline by any Middlebury program in which the student is or will be enrolled or their home institution.
