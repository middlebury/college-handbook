All Schools Abroad students will be held accountable for policy violations of the [Middlebury Handbook](https://www.middlebury.edu/handbook/) and of those policies defined herein, as well as violations of the host university’s policies and rules (as applicable), which take place between the first day of orientation for the School Abroad program and the completion of the program. Conduct that occurs at or in connection with a School Abroad-related event, or occurs off-site but violates the law or may represent a threat to the safety of the School Abroad community or its members, the pursuit of the program’s objectives, and/or the educational environment of others, may be subject to the disciplinary process and sanctions outlined in [Section II.B.2 of the Middlebury Handbook](https://www.middlebury.edu/handbook/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/). This includes violation of any of the below policies, which may result in discipline up to and including expulsion from a Middlebury School Abroad or any other Middlebury program:

*   Violation of Middlebury’s [Policies Governing Student Conduct, Residential Life, and Student Organizations](https://www.middlebury.edu/handbook/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/)
*   Violation of [Middlebury-Wide Policies](https://www.middlebury.edu/handbook/pages/i-policies-for-all/) including but not limited to [Respectful Behavior](https://www.middlebury.edu/handbook/pages/i-policies-for-all/genl-principles/respectful-behavior/) and [Honesty and Cooperation in Middlebury Matters](https://www.middlebury.edu/handbook/pages/i-policies-for-all/genl-principles/honesty-cooperation/)
*   Violation of Middlebury’s [Non-Discrimination Policy](https://www.middlebury.edu/handbook/pages/i-policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/b-1-a-non-discrimination-policy/)
*   Violation of Middlebury’s [Policy Against Hazing](https://www.middlebury.edu/handbook/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/hazing-policy/)
*   Violation of Middlebury’s [Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs Policy](https://www.middlebury.edu/handbook/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/alcohol-drugs/)
*   Violation of Middlebury’s [Minors on Campus policy](https://www.middlebury.edu/handbook/pages/i-policies-for-all/health-safety/minors-on-campus/)
*   Violation of Middlebury’s [Academic Honesty, the Honor Code and Related Disciplinary Policies](https://www.middlebury.edu/handbook/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/acad-honesty/)
*   Violation of the laws of the host country
*   Violation of the rules or policies of the host entity
*   Violation of program rules or policies regarding housing

Alleged policy violations shall be reported to the Director of the School Abroad. The Director or designee (hereinafter referred to as “the Director”) is ordinarily responsible for addressing alleged violations pertaining to academic honesty, respectful behavior and/or general conduct. The applicable disciplinary processes found in the Middlebury Handbook, as noted above, will apply. Cases involving alleged violations of non-discrimination and Title IX policies will be referred directly to [Middlebury’s Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/title-IX/about) for further handling.

If a complaint or report of an alleged policy violation is made against a School Abroad student, the accused student will be given notice of the alleged violation and an opportunity to respond to the allegations prior to any determination or disciplinary action. The notice may be given orally or in writing. The “opportunity to respond” means that the student will be given an opportunity to meet and/or communicate with the Director. 

In cases where a student is found responsible for a policy violation while participating in the School Abroad, the finding of responsibility may also be referred to the appropriate authority overseeing the student’s home institution or any additional Middlebury or non-Middlebury program in which the student is or will be enrolled for other action as deemed appropriate. Nothing in this section shall preclude the host university (if applicable) from exercising its independent right to suspend, expel or otherwise discipline a student in accordance with its own procedures.

In certain circumstances involving alleged policy violations (e.g., involved individuals are enrolled in or employed by a foreign university or a non-Middlebury program) the host university’s disciplinary procedures or the local court system may supersede Middlebury’s procedures in that location. In these situations, the School Abroad Director, and/or other Middlebury official(s) will work closely with the local staff or faculty at the host university (or local law enforcement, if applicable) to ensure that the matter is appropriately addressed.  Middlebury will, nonetheless, take steps within the scope of its authority designed to prevent the recurrence of harassment, sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, or stalking, and remedy the effects of such behavior. 

Middlebury retains sole discretion to determine whether to initiate disciplinary or other action under its policies against a student who is or will be enrolled in another Middlebury program (including the undergraduate program) regardless of the outcome of any disciplinary proceeding conducted by a non-Middlebury institution or program and/or the outcome of any law enforcement investigation or court proceeding. 

_a) Appeals_

A student may appeal the Director’s decision within three business days of issuance of the determination. The evidence will be forwarded to the appropriate administrator in the Office of Community Standards (OCS) on the Vermont campus. OCS will address the matter consistent with the [Student Conduct](https://www.middlebury.edu/handbook/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/general-disciplinary-process/#appeals) process.
