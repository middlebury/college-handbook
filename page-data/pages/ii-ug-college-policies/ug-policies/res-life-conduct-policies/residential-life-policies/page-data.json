All students are assigned to one of five <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/residential-life/commons-system\">Commons</a> for the first two years. Juniors and seniors can choose from other housing options available across campus while remaining a member of their original Commons. Middlebury maintains houses in the belief that they can be a positive addition to the larger campus community and that they provide students with valuable opportunities for assuming responsibility for activities and programs that support the life of the Middlebury community.</p>\n<p>In addition to First year and Sophomore housing with the Commons, the College offers Academic and Special Interest Houses that students can join on campus for students interested in pursuing common academic, co-curricular, and special interests. Oversight of these houses is the shared responsibility of the Office of the Dean of Students and the academic (in the case of Academic Interest houses) or administrative (in the case of special interest houses) department sponsoring the house. Rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors are eligible to reside in Academic Interest Houses. Students can choose from the other housing options in their junior and senior year.</p>\n<p>More information on joining these houses and the Room Draw process can be found at: <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/housing-information\">https://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/community-living/housing-information</a></p>\n<p>Middlebury reserves the right to reassign, restrict, and, suspend student housing where that decision will serve a compelling community interest, or in instances where a student has demonstrated a flagrant and/or repeated disregard for the principles set forth in the Handbook. This includes the restriction from participating in room draw and housing selection.</p>\n<h4 id=\"student\" style=\"position:relative;\"><strong>(3) Student Responsibilities and Expectations</strong><a href=\"#student\" aria-label=\"student permalink\" class=\"anchor-link after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"0.75em\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"0.75em\" data-view-component=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link flex-shrink-0 mr-2\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z\"></path></svg></a></h4>\n<p>Residential Living Spaces are provided for Middlebury students only.</p>\n<p>Students are responsible for what takes place in their rooms and common suite space, including parties and other activities, whether or not they are present. It is the student’s responsibility to maintain clean and sanitary conditions in dormitory rooms, and must clear common space after personal use.</p>\n<p>Students cannot switch rooms and keys or change residences without proper permission.</p>\n<p>Students are not expected to be in areas that are not regular living spaces. They should not use areas outside of their living spaces for storage unless authorized. The list of spaces excluded from student use includes any roof or outer surface of any Middlebury building. Accessing a roof in any manner or climbing on a building is considered dangerous behavior and is prohibited; fines will be assessed.  Unauthorized access to prohibited areas of Middlebury buildings (e. g. basements, closets, crawlspaces and/or attics) will incur fines (see <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/support/sfs/sfs-handbook\">section on fines and fees</a>).</p>\n<p>Students are expected to be considerate of others with respect to noise in the residence halls; see <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/publicsafety/Noise_Regulations\">Noise Regulations</a> for more information. Conduct that creates a public disturbance in a residence hall or interferes with another student’s ability to study is prohibited.</p>\n<p>Students are expected to be responsible for their personal valuables and belongings. Middlebury does not accept responsibility for loss of money or other personal property or damage thereto which may occur in residence halls and elsewhere on campus. Students may wish to insure their property against such loss.</p>\n<p>Students may not remove Middlebury-provided furniture from their bedroom for any reason, including but not limited to bedframes, mattresses, dressers, bookcases, chairs, desks and wardrobes. Removal of any College furniture without proper permission will result in a fine. Limited medical or ADA exceptions may be granted with appropriate approval.

Entry into Student Residence Halls, Houses and Suites</strong><br>\nThe Department of Public Safety is responsible for patrolling residential areas on campus and may enter student residence halls and houses in order to perform their duties (examples: locking the building, responding to complaints and calls for service, party checks, etc.). Since many residential houses need to be patrolled and may require checks or locking (examples: Homestead, Jewett, Weybridge, The Mill), officers may enter the communal areas as appropriate. Public Safety officers respect a student's right to privacy and do not enter more private areas such as suites or very small houses without knocking and gaining permission to enter, unless conducting a party check, addressing significant Middlebury policy violations, or in accordance with the other entry policies listed above.</p>\n<p><strong>ii. Possession and Securing of Evidence</strong> <br>\nThe Department of Public Safety is authorized to enter a student's residence to take possession of and secure evidence of a serious Middlebury policy violation. Department of Public Safety and other Middlebury officials should enter a student's room only under certain circumstances and in conformity with the procedures outlined in Entry into Residential Rooms. In the event that stolen property or prohibited/illegal goods are observed, the items will be confiscated, notice will be sent to the Commons for appropriate action, and the occupants of the room will be notified.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Procedure for Entry in Non-Emergency Situation</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Community Service</strong><br>\nMiddlebury officials may enter a student dormitory room to perform a community service: e.g., to turn off an unattended alarm clock or radio, to mitigate property damage, or to allow authorized designees to retrieve residents’ belongings.</li>\n<li><strong>Routine Inspections and Repairs</strong><br>\nMiddlebury conducts routine inspections of student rooms in the dormitories to check on violations of health and safety regulations and to recover misappropriated property. Inspections are held at reasonable times, in a manner that will least inconvenience residents. Students are notified by voice-mail and written notice at least 24 hours but not more than two weeks prior to the inspection. Students discovered in violation of health and safety regulations, or in possession of stolen property or illegal goods, are subject to normal Middlebury disciplinary action as appropriate. During vacation periods, student rooms in Middlebury-owned housing are inspected to check heat settings, to ensure that lights and appliances are turned off, and that windows are closed. Following such inspections, or at other times, facilities services personnel may enter student rooms to make repairs. (See <a href=\"#notification\">Notification of Entry, below</a>.) Occasionally, Middlebury officials may need to enter a room for reasons other than those listed in this section, such as to evaluate a room for planning purposes and space needs. In these circumstances, 24-hour notice will be given and the requester will attempt to coordinate a mutually agreeable time with the student.</li>\n<li><strong>Communications Infrastructure Maintenance</strong><br>\nImproperly configured or malfunctioning computer or communication equipment can seriously degrade the operation of Middlebury's communication networks. It may be necessary for personnel to enter a student room to confirm the location of such a device, and, if necessary, disconnect it from the network until the situation can be resolved. ITS will attempt to contact the student before entering the room, but time-critical situations, where significant network services are impacted, may require entry without prior approval. Students' computers will not be touched without their prior consent; room entry will be only for the purpose of confirming that the misbehaving computer has been properly identified. For the protection of the student, the Department of Public Safety and/or the Commons office will be notified if entry is made without prior approval. Any temporary disconnection will be made in the network equipment closet, without directly handling students' property.</li>\n<li>If students request assistance from ITS to repair a problem with their network connection, they may give ITS permission to enter the room and disconnect equipment for testing and troubleshooting in their absence. Similarly, Telephone Services personnel may enter student rooms in the residents' absence to effect repairs to voice telephone equipment or infrastructure. (See <a href=\"#notification\">Notification of Entry, below</a>.)</li>\n<li><strong>Procedure for Entry in Emergency Situation</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Emergency Entry</strong> <br>\nMiddlebury officials are authorized to enter a student's room without prior notice in emergency circumstances, such as a fire, fire alarm, fire drill, an immediate threat to health, safety or property, a call for help, or what reasonably seems to constitute an emergency situation.</li>\n<li><strong>Special Room Inspection</strong><br>\nIn addition to the circumstances described above, Middlebury officials may initiate entry of a room and/or a room search when there is reason to believe that a serious violation of Middlebury policy has been committed and/or the evidence may be found in a student's room. Searches of this nature will not be conducted without prior authorization of an appropriate senior Middlebury official. When possible, the student or students concerned and a witness shall be present when a room search is conducted. (See <a href=\"#notification\">Notification of Entry, below</a>.)</li>\n<li>Students living in Middlebury-owned housing have the right to be free from unlawful room searches conducted by law enforcement officials. In most instances, a lawful search must be conducted pursuant to a warrant issued upon a showing of probable cause. Middlebury officials must arrange with law enforcement authorities to obtain a search warrant before searching a student's room for evidence which they intend to turn over for purposes of criminal prosecution. If a police officer sees a student commit what reasonably appears to be a criminal offense or violation of local ordinances, however, Middlebury will not interfere with the officer's legal pursuit of the student into a dormitory and into a student room.

Students with special medical needs that necessitate a housing accommodation should address their concerns to Residential Life and the Student Accessibility Services. Students who are married or have dependent children living with them are exempted from the residency and board requirements upon providing documentation to Residential Life.</p>\n<p><strong>Procedure to Request Living Off-Campus</strong></p>\n<p>Middlebury permits a limited number of seniors to live off campus. Permission is granted by a process coordinated by the Office of the Dean of Students. Students with the status of \"special students\" are required to live off campus. The number of off-campus residents is based on our commitment to the residential experience and an evaluation of the rental market in the town of Middlebury. Off-Campus status requires the approval of the Commons dean. Approval may not be granted if a student has been subject to official College discipline or academic failure.  Students living off campus must provide their local address and phone number to Middlebury’s residential systems coordinator within the first five days of the term or the Off-Campus Fee Reduction will be forfeited.</p>\n<p>All Off-Campus forms must be turned in to the residential systems coordinator by the determined <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/office/residential-life/housing-overview\">deadlines</a>. Any student wishing to move off campus after the Off-Campus application deadline must notify the residential systems coordinator to be placed on a waiting list. Off-campus permission is granted through a random draw each term for the subsequent term. Applications are submitted electronically; students may apply as individuals or in groups up to three members.  Students who accept off-campus housing status are ineligible to participate in further fall term housing processes.</p>\n<p>Permission must be granted for each term a student wants to live off campus and an Off-Campus Fee Reduction Form must be submitted by the posted deadline.  A form submitted one term will not automatically transfer to the next term. Students living off campus for one term will be given priority to live off campus for the next term as long as there have been no disciplinary, academic or behavioral concerns raised during the previous term. Completing the form every term provides the Office of the Dean of Students with up-to-date residential information.</p>\n<p>Students who accept off-campus housing status and then request to move back on campus will be placed on a waiting list and housed by the residential systems coordinator following the completion of the housing processes taking place at that time.  There is no guarantee of housing for these students.</p>\n<p>Students who choose to live off-campus without authorization - that is, students who are not granted off-campus status but move off-campus nonetheless - will be subject to official discipline.</p>\n<p>Students who live off campus are expected to be good citizens. Students who violate Middlebury policy or local ordinances will be subject to Middleburydiscipline.</p>\n<p>Living on campus is considered to be an essential component of the educational experience at Middlebury. Request for off-campus housing on the basis of a medical or ADA-certified need will be considered on a case-by-case basis and will require appropriate documentation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"termination\" style=\"position:relative;\"><strong>(6) Termination of a House</strong><a href=\"#termination\" aria-label=\"termination permalink\" class=\"anchor-link after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"0.75em\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"0.75em\" data-view-component=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link flex-shrink-0 mr-2\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z\"></path></svg></a></h4>\n<p>The Vice President of Student Affairs/Dean of Students (VPSA) will recommend to the President termination of a house at Middlebury in the following circumstances:</p>\n<p>a. for disciplinary reasons if there is an extraordinary violation by a house of Middlebury’s rules and regulations for students in houses.</p>\n<p>b.for disciplinary reasons if there are repeated violations by a house of Middlebury rules and regulations.  The VPSA may issue appropriate sanctions to a house for violations of rules and regulations.
