Incompletes are granted by the Student Life Dean, after consultation with the faculty member involved. In order for the dean to grant an incomplete, the faculty member will provide the dean and the Office of the Registrar with a provisional grade that would be assigned if the remaining work in the course were not completed. When the faculty member submits grades for the course, they will submit an incomplete for the student.</p>\n<p>The Dean will share the provisional grade with the student and will set the deadline for the submission of all remaining work, which will ordinarily be before the deadline for adding classes in the following Fall or Spring semester. The deadline may be no later than the deadline to drop classes in the following semester. Incompletes in winter term courses will follow the same procedures: the deadline for the submission of all remaining work may be no later than the deadline to drop classes in the Spring semester. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that all work is completed by the deadline.  Should the faculty member be unavailable to evaluate the remaining work, it will be the responsibility of the department chair or program director, or designee, to complete the evaluation of submitted work. If the course is not completed by the deadline, the provisional grade based on the work that has been completed will be recorded by the Office of the Registrar. </p>\n<p>If the Office of the Registrar has not received either a provisional or a final grade by the deadline, the grade will ordinarily be recorded as an F. The Office of the Registrar will notify the student that the grade has been recorded. Students seeking incompletes based on a disability or medical condition should be directed to the Disability Resource Center (DRC) Office. When the DRC staff determines that an incomplete is a reasonable accommodation for a disability, the dean will be notified and will grant the incomplete, which should ordinarily follow the procedures described above, unless the DRC Office determines a modification is necessary.</p>\n<h4 id=\"7-change-in-grades\" style=\"position:relative;\"><strong>7.

The official transcript contains information on courses taken, grades received, majors and minors, degrees earned and honors awarded. The transcript also includes a student's semester and cumulative grade point average, calculated using the numerical equivalents in Section A above. The grades used in calculating the grade point average are those earned in the Middlebury undergraduate, summer, and overseas schools, all other approved programs abroad, and approved programs of domestic off-campus study.</p>\n<p>The transcript and information in the student file may be released to persons or organizations outside of the College only with specific written authorization from the student or as permitted by the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), as noted in the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/handbook/pages/i-policies-for-all/records/ferpa/\">Student Privacy Rights under U.S. Federal Law</a> (FERPA) section of the Handbook.</p>\n<p>A fee of $5 is charged for each official transcript requested. A request form is available at <a href=\"https://go.middlebury.edu/transcript\">https://go.middlebury.edu/transcript</a>. Transcript requests are accepted by mail, and in person Monday through Friday in the Service Building during regular office hours.  Students may also request a transcript through the online ordering system. An additional surcharge is applied to transcript orders placed via the online ordering system. Please plan on two days for processing requests, and longer during end of term grading periods.  Students and alumni continue to have access to their own academic records on BannerWeb. No transcript will be issued to students who are financially indebted to the College until satisfactory arrangements have been made with the Office of Student Financial Services.</p>\n<h4 id=\"11-registrar\" style=\"position:relative;\"><strong>11.  Registrar</strong><a href=\"#11-registrar\" aria-label=\"11 registrar permalink\" class=\"anchor-link after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"0.75em\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"0.75em\" data-view-component=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link flex-shrink-0 mr-2\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z\"></path></svg></a></h4>\n<p><strong>Office of the Registrar</strong><br>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:registrar@middlebury.edu\">registrar@middlebury.edu</a> <br>\nWebsite: <a href=\"https://go.middlebury.edu/registrar\">https://go.middlebury.edu/registrar</a><br>\nPhone: 802.443.5770</p>\n<p>Currently enrolled students should contact this office if they have questions about their academic transcripts or procedures regarding registration, dropping or adding courses, or transfer of credit.</p>\n<p><em>rev. 6/24/21</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"B.1.k.
