Specific guidelines concerning non-standard grading can be found in the College Handbook under <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/about/college-handbook-2017-revision/II.-policies-for-the-undergraduate-college/policies-for-undergrads/academic-policies/degree-requirements\">Degree Requirements</a>.</p>\n<p>b. Students may invoke the CR/NCR option for a single course when they are enrolled in courses totaling at least four credits in that semester.</p>\n<p>c. Courses taken under the Credit/No Credit option may not be used to satisfy distribution, College Writing, First-Year Seminar, or cultures and civilizations requirements.</p>\n<p>d. Courses taken under the Credit/No Credit option may not be used to satisfy major or minor requirements, with one exception: a first course taken under the Credit/No Credit option in a department or program in which a student subsequently declares a major or minor may, <em>with the approval of the department chair or program director</em>, be counted toward major or minor requirements.</p>\n<p>e. Students may elect the Credit/No Credit option for a course in which they are already registered during the first  eight weeks of the classes.  The deadline for changing a course from Credit/No Credit to standard grading or vice versa is the drop deadline (i.e., the end of the  eighth week of  classes).</p>\n<p>f. Winter Term: Students may not elect the Credit/No Credit option for winter term courses that are otherwise offered with standard grading.  Occasionally the Curriculum Committee gives an instructor permission to offer an entire course as pass/fail or honors/pass/fail; if a student takes one of these courses, it will not count as one of the permitted two Pass/D/Fail or Credit/No Credit courses, but it will count toward the total of five courses with non-standard grading a student may count toward graduation.</p>\n<p>g. Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey (MIIS) and Study Abroad: Students may not elect the Credit/No Credit option for courses taken abroad or at MIIS. However, courses taken at MIIS or within an approved study abroad program in the fall, winter, or spring semester that are offered in their entirety as pass/fail—including study abroad internships—will not count as one of the Credit/No Credit courses, but will count toward the total of five courses with non-standard grading a student may count toward graduation.</p>\n<p>h. CR and NCR grades will not be calculated in the student’s GPA.  A minimum grade of C- is required for CR.  NCR will be recorded for grades of D or F.</p>\n<h4 id=\"auditing\" style=\"position:relative;\"><strong>4.

The APC regards these lists as informative. They are an <em>explanation</em> for an absence, but they do not imply that the student is excused from the obligations of a course or the class work missed.</p>\n<p>Although faculty members are expected to make their policy on course attendance clear at the beginning of each course, it is the individual student's responsibility to consult with his or her instructor as to the effect of explained absences.</p>\n<p><em><strong>To the Professor:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Please read the guidelines for students and coaches in the following sections regarding \"Explained Absences.\" Note that it is the student's responsibility to approach you in the first week of the course to identify possible conflicts between their athletics schedule and your course. However, it would be helpful if you, during the first week of classes, remind students of their obligation.</p>\n<p>How you handle missed work is entirely up to you. However, it is the College's policy that athletics are an important part of a student's life at Middlebury. There are a number of possible solutions to missed work. For example, if a lab or discussion is missed, the student may be able to attend a different section meeting. If a paper is due, ask that the paper to be handed in prior to the student's leaving. If a lecture is to be missed, you may permit the student to record the lecture (with assistance from another student). We do recognize, however, that there are cases for which there is no satisfactory make-up possible. Please do your best to accommodate the student without sacrificing academic rigor.</p>\n<p>After a student has approached you, please:</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Identify work that will be missed.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Do your best to find a solution to missed material.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Communicate your decision clearly to the student. When a student has approached you at the beginning of a semester regarding conflicts, it is your responsibility to communicate your decision on missed work before the end of the drop/add period.</p>\n<p>Please note that if a student is involved in a winter or spring season sport, they may not be aware of scheduling conflicts until the semester or term is underway. Again, it is the student's responsibility to approach you as soon as his or her schedule is set to make arrangements regarding missed work, and it is your responsibility to communicate in a timely manner your decision on how to handle the missed work.</p>\n<p>Additionally, at the beginning of the semester, you are encouraged to make students aware of any important class activities that will fall outside the normal class schedule of Monday-Friday 8 a.m.-4:15 p.m. and Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday 7:30-10:25 p.m.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note</strong></em> that missing a regularly scheduled class for a practice in no way constitutes an explained absence and is not expected or mandated by coaching faculty.</p>\n<p><em><strong>To the Student:</strong></em></p>\n<p>You should be given a list of dates and times of scheduled games by your coach no later than the first day of classes in any term or semester in which you are involved in a varsity/junior varsity sport, or in the case of winter or spring season sports, by whichever comes first, the first preseason meeting or the first day of practice (November 1 for winter, February 15 for spring). Compare each class schedule with your schedule of games. For any course in which you see a potential conflict between academic and athletic schedules, it is your responsibility to contact the professor during the first week of class, or as soon as the scheduling conflicts are known (for example, in the case of winter season sports that begin late in the fall term) and:</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Identify times of conflict.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Together arrive at an understanding of how missed work/class might be made up.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Please note:</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Professors will do their best to accommodate your needs within reason.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> The professor will make the final decision as to how the missed work is to be made up. In cases where you approach the professor at the beginning of term, it is the professor's responsibility to arrive at this decision in time for you to drop/add if her/his decision is unsatisfactory to you. There are some cases for which there may be no satisfactory makeup possible.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Conflicts with official practices are also possible in the case of special class events, such as a guest lecturer. In such cases, you should discuss the situation with both your professor and your coach, and make a decision with full understanding of the ramifications of your decision.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> Conflicts should be resolved through discussions between yourself, your professor, and your coach. If there are difficulties, you may consult with your Student Life Dean.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note</strong></em> that missing a regularly scheduled class for a practice in no way constitutes an explained absence and is not expected or mandated by coaching faculty.</p>\n<p><em><strong>To the Coach:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Please read the statements for the students and the professors on the preceding sections and note your role in this process. We ask you to:</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> On or before the first day of each semester, or at the start of the season, give each student on the team you coach the list of contests that conflict with the normal 8 a.m.-4:15 p.m. Monday-Friday and Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday 7:30-10:25 p.m. class hours.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Remind students that it is their responsibility to contact each of their professors and identify potential time/work conflicts.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Explain to the students that there may be times when a practice needs to be missed for special class events (such as a guest lecturer). In such cases, the student should inform you of the potential conflict and discuss it with both you and the professor. It is important that students be able to make such decisions concerning conflicts with full information as to the ramifications of their decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> There will be times when it is in the best interest of the student to attend class rather than a game, and we encourage you to support the student in such a case.</p>\n<p>We believe that your role as a coach is very important. Students often look more to their coaches than to their professors for guidance on these issues. It is important that you understand the College policy and do your best to help resolve conflicts between these two very important, but sometimes competing, aspects of students' lives at Middlebury.</p>\n<p><em><strong>To the Captains:</strong></em></p>\n<p>As a team leader, you should encourage your team members to meet with professors to discuss possible scheduling conflicts. Please ensure that your team members are aware of these guidelines on explained absences and understand that the process is one of negotiation among the coach, student, and professor.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Class Lectures and Presentations</strong></p>\n<p>Classroom lectures or presentations at the College are the intellectual property of the individual professor, Middlebury College, and/or both. The copying, publication, or distribution of any transcripts, audio, or video of such lectures or presentations without prior written approval of the individual professor is prohibited.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Religious Holidays</strong></p>\n<p>Middlebury College recognizes that the student body includes adherents of many faiths and that observance of religious holidays is an important part of religious practice for many students. The following policies have been established in order that students at Middlebury will not suffer academic penalties because of the conscientious observance of religious holidays:</p>\n<p>It is reasonable to consider major religious holidays for the Middlebury student body as a whole to include the following: Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and the first day of Passover; Good Friday and Easter Sunday; Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Examinations should not be scheduled and papers should not be due on any of these holidays. Absences from class on these days because of observance of the religious holiday will be treated as excused absences. In addition, no student will be required to participate in or attend College events such as athletic contests, concerts, or outside lectures on these holidays.</p>\n<p>The Office of the Dean of the College will include the dates of these major religious holidays on the academic calendars that are distributed to the faculty and published on the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/calendar/2017-2018\">College's website</a>. These calendars will indicate those instances in which the religious holiday begins on the previous evening.</p>\n<p>Students whose conscientious religious observance requires their absence on days other than or in addition to those named above may make use of the following procedure prior to the holiday: The student should submit written notification of the pending religious holiday to his or her Student Life Dean at least one week before the holiday. The Student Life Dean will then inform the instructors of the student's courses that the absence on the religious holiday will be regarded as an excused one. Under these circumstances, a student missing an examination will be permitted to take a makeup exam without penalty, and a student with a paper due on a religious holiday will be permitted to submit that paper on the day immediately following the holiday, again without penalty.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"B.1.f.
