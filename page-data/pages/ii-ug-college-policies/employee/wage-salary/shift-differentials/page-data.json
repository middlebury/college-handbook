Shift differentials are automatically calculated in Oracle based upon the start and stop times that are recorded on a time card. Shift differentials are paid only for hours worked and are included in the calculation of overtime pay rates. Differentials are not paid for CTO, SLR, bereavement, holiday, and other time off.</p>\n<p>Departmental exceptions to this policy must be approved by Human Resources. Ineligible positions include tipped employee jobs and student jobs (contact Human Resources for complete list).Â  Shift differential amounts will be periodically reviewed.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"6.4 Shift Differentials"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"312addd3-aaa7-5082-9705-e546007ae054","frontmatter__slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/wage-salary/shift-differentials","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"pages"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2212765230","3000541721"]}
