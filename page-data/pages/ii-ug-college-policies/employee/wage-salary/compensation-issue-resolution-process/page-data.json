The supervisor and department head should be sure that the employee's expectations under the compensation program are reasonable and that the employee understands the program as it relates to his or her particular situation. Following the evaluation, if the supervisor determines there needs to be further review, the supervisor or department head and the employee should make an appointment with Human Resources to discuss the position and the decision. Human Resources will reevaluate its original position in light of any new information. The decision resulting from the Human Resources review will be final.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"6.5 Compensation Issue Resolution Process"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e0f1b9cb-b805-524c-95e1-7bc3571d68d0","frontmatter__slug":"/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee/wage-salary/compensation-issue-resolution-process","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"pages"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2212765230","3000541721"]}
