Matters of the Language School faculty may be guided by the principles of the Faculty Handbook. Language School staff are subject to the <a href=\"/handbook/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/employee\">Employee Handbook</a> policies applicable to their specific employment category. All Language Schools students attending programs outside of the Middlebury Campus (e.g., Bennington College, Paris and Buenos Aires) are also subject to the policies applicable to those programs.</p>\n<p>These policies may be amended from time to time and therefore students, faculty and staff should review the most current online version for any updates. Any amendments as published on this website shall supersede wholly any prior versions of the policy(ies). Middlebury endeavors to present an accurate overview of the programs, facilities, and fees of the Language Schools in this handbook. However, Middlebury reserves the right to alter any program, facilities, or fees, described below or in other publications without notice or obligation.</p>\n<p>Middlebury College has unrestricted right to use and publish photographs taken of participants while enrolled at the Middlebury College summer programs.
