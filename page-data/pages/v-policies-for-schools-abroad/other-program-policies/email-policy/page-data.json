Students from other colleges and universities are issued a Middlebury email address (<a href=\"mailto:username@middlebury.edu\">username@middlebury.edu</a>) upon enrollment in the program.  This Middlebury-issued email address will be used by Middlebury for official communication with students.  The College expects that such communications, many of which are time-sensitive, will be received and read.   Middlebury provides an email forwarding service that allows students to read their email via other service providers.
