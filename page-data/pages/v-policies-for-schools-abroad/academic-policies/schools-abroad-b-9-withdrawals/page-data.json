All programs are considered to start on the first day of orientation for fall or spring-only students, and again on the first day of spring classes for academic year students.</p>\n<p>Students who withdraw after the on-site registration period will receive grades of “WD”; refunds apply as per the Withdrawal Refund Schedule outlined in <a href=\"/handbook/pages/v-policies-for-schools-abroad/financial-policies/withdrawal-refund-schedule\">Section C.4</a>. A grade of “WDF” as indicated on the back of the Middlebury College transcript applies only to Language Schools and not to Schools Abroad. Students who are dismissed or who withdraw after the on-site registration period and before the last week of classes will receive a grade of “WD” in all of their courses.</p>\n<p>Students who are dismissed or who voluntarily withdraw during the last week of classes (five class days prior to the start of exams) or after will receive a grade of “F” in all of their courses.</p>\n<p>In exceptional circumstances, and when indicated by a medical or health care professional, students may request permission to withdraw from one (and only one) course, rather than withdraw entirely from the program. If permission to withdraw from a specific course is granted by the Director/Principal of the School Abroad, the student would stop all work related to that course and receive a “WD” on their transcript for that course.</p>\n<p>Middlebury undergraduate students who receive permission to withdraw from a course abroad should understand that because of the reduced course load, they will no longer be eligible for a WTEQ (winter-term equivalent credit), where applicable.</p>\n<p>Although this is the policy for a student’s Middlebury transcript, depending on the laws of the host country, a failing grade or a failure to complete the course may become a part of a student’s permanent academic record at the host institution.</p>\n<p><em><strong>a) Paperwork &#x26; Procedures for Withdrawal from a School Abroad</strong></em><br>\nA student must notify the Director/Principal of the School Abroad in writing of the intent to voluntarily withdraw and the Director/Principal should complete the withdrawal form and send it to the student for a signature. The Director/Principal must send that withdrawal form to International Programs within 30 days of withdrawal. The Dean of International Programs (for undergraduates) and the Dean of Language Schools (for graduates), in consultation with the Director/Principal, may impose conditions on readmission designed to support the student's health and academic success.</p>\n<p><em><strong>b) Notice to the Student's Home Institution</strong></em></p>\n<p>Middlebury reserves the right to notify all institutions or programs in which the student is (or will be) enrolled of any withdrawal or dismissal of the student from a Middlebury School Abroad.</p>\n<p><em><strong>c) Readmission</strong></em></p>\n<p>A student who would like to seek readmission to a School Abroad after withdrawal should refer to the Middlebury Handbook section on <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/handbook/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/student-status/\">Student Status</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"B.9.
