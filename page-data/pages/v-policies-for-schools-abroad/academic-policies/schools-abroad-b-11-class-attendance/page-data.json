Attendance is required throughout your courses.  Travel and other absences must be reserved for those periods when your attendance in class, or at other academic or mandatory events, is not required’.  Regular or repeated absences without a medical excuse or similar extenuating circumstances are considered unexcused absences and may result in course warnings and will ultimately affect the final grade. When disruptive to the program, this can result in the student’s dismissal from the School Abroad.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Visits by parents, relatives, or friends do not constitute a valid excuse for not attending classes or completing assignments on time.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Students are generally not permitted to make private arrangements for submission of required work or completion of exams with individual instructors. Students engaging in such activities may have their final grades reduced.</p>\n<p>Early submission of coursework is not an excuse to leave early, nor should work be submitted after the deadline established by the instructor. In case of illness, students are advised to seek medical advice promptly, so as to avoid complications. It is the student's responsibility to keep the School informed of their progress by personally telephoning the office staff, to present a medical certificate, and to make up work missed after consulting with the instructor. Failure to adhere to these regulations may result in a lower grade or failure in the course.</p>\n<p>Students are expected to complete the program in-country.  Departing before the official end day of the program, per the relevant School Abroad calendar, is not permitted.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"B.11.
