Stalking is defined as two or more acts that would cause a reasonable person to fear for the person’s safety or the safety of others, OR to suffer substantial emotional distress.  Stalking can include non-consensual communication in any manner; pursuing, waiting or showing up uninvited in places frequented by the person; surveillance or voyeurism, trespassing, vandalism, non-consensual touching, threats, threats to harm oneself, and use of a third party to accomplish any of these actions.</p>\n<p>Finally, behavior that violates common standards of decency, fails to comply with local laws or statutes, or demonstrates contempt for the generally accepted values of the intellectual community is prohibited.</p>\n<h4 id=\"b-communicating-with-honesty-and-integrity\" style=\"position:relative;\"><strong>B.
