To meet the Institute's health insurance requirement, you must do one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enroll</strong> in the <a href=\"https://www.jcbins.com/\">Student Health Insurance Plan</a> offered through JCB Insurance Solutions. Enter \"Middlebury Institute of International Studies\" and follow the prompts from there.</li>\n<li><strong>Waive</strong> the <a href=\"https://www.jcbins.com/\">Student Health Insurance Plan</a> by providing proof of existing health insurance that has accident, illness and emergency coverage. In the case of international students, government or socialized health care provided by your home countries is acceptable, provided that it covers you in the United States.  Instructions on how to waive are listed below.\n<ul>\n<li>Waive the plan by clicking on this page:  <a href=\"https://www.jcbins.com/\">Student Health Insurance Plan</a></li>\n<li>Enter \"Middlebury Institute of International Studies.\"  Select the appropriate academic year and select the \"MIIS Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP)\" as “what kind of student are you.”</li>\n<li>Then scroll down on the new page and find the box that says “Already have insurance?” and click the button that says “Submit waiver here.”</li>\n<li>You will be prompted to make an account - enter your personal information and insurance details. Your “documents” proving the insurance should be front and back scans of your insurance card OR a screenshot of a confirmation email about your insurance if you don’t have a card.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>This step is required each semester</strong> unless selecting the annual option when enrolling; the waiver is annual. The health insurance requirement should be satisfied by 4 p.m. on the first day of classes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"fall-2018---summer2019plan-information\" style=\"position:relative;\"><strong>Fall 2018 - Summer 2019 Plan Information</strong><a href=\"#fall-2018---summer2019plan-information\" aria-label=\"fall 2018   summer2019plan information permalink\" class=\"anchor-link after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"0.75em\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"0.75em\" data-view-component=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link flex-shrink-0 mr-2\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z\"></path></svg></a></h4>\n<p>Download the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/sites/www.middlebury.edu.institute/files/2018-05/MIIS%2018-19%20Insurance%20Summary.pdf\">plan overview.</a></p>\n<p>Download the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/sites/www.middlebury.edu.institute/files/2018-05/MIIS%2018-19%20brochure%20FINAL%205-25-18.pdf\">plan details.</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"other-health-insurance-options\" style=\"position:relative;\"><strong>Other Health Insurance Options</strong><a href=\"#other-health-insurance-options\" aria-label=\"other health insurance options permalink\" class=\"anchor-link after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"0.75em\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"0.75em\" data-view-component=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link flex-shrink-0 mr-2\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z\"></path></svg></a></h4>\n<p>Should you decide to opt out of the Middlebury Institute Student Health Insurance Plan, you must provide proof that you have other health insurance.
