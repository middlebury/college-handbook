If a student has <strong>not</strong> done acceptable work in the majority of course requirements or assignments prior to the illness or emergency that prevented completion of the course, a letter grade shall be assigned. An “I” is not appropriate for cases in which the principal requirement for the course is unfinished by the end of an academic term, e.g., a Capstone, Thesis, Business Plan, or Program Portfolio (please see below, Assignment of “In Progress”).</p>\n<p>Process for assigning and removing an Incomplete:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The instructor submits a grade of Incomplete to the Records Office, accompanied by a written agreement with the student regarding the work to be completed and the deadline for completion. (This deadline should be as early as possible and may under no circumstances exceed one calendar year.)</li>\n<li>The instructor evaluates the completed work as soon after its submission as possible. The instructor shall complete and submit a Change of Grade form to the Records Office to replace the “I” with the appropriate grade.</li>\n<li>An “I” that is not changed by this procedure becomes a permanent grade on the student’s transcript. In this case, the \"I\" is not used to calculate the Grade Point Average.</li>\n<li>If a grade of Incomplete in a course required for the student's degree is not removed according to the above provisions, the student may be required to repeat the course (or an appropriate equivalent), paying additional tuition, if necessary, to satisfy the requirement of the degree.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> According to current federal law regarding International students with F-1 and J-1 visas, eligibility to remain in the country beyond the period of 30/60 days after the end of classes is not extended to allow for the completion of Incompletes.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A.6.e.
