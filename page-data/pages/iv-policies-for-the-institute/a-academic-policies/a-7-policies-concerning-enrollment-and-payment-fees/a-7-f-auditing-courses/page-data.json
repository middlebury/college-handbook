Full-time students, (registered for 12 credits or more), may audit up to four (4) credits per semester without charge. Full-time students who register to audit more than four (4) credits in any semester will be charged at one-half the regular per-credit rate for each credit over four (4) credits audited.</p>\n<p>Part-time students who wish to audit courses may do so by registering in the Records Office and by paying one-half the regular credit rate for each credit audited. When a part-time (11 credits or less) student’s per credit fees exceed the comprehensive fee that a full-time student would pay, then those students may also audit up to four credits per semester without charge.</p>\n<p>The instructor of record establishes the student attendance requirements and required deliverables for auditing a course and has the right to refuse auditors. No credit is awarded for courses that are audited. The student’s permanent record shows an AU for audit if the student has met the instructor’s attendance requirements for awarding an AU. If the student fails to meet the instructor’s attendance requirements, the instructor of record so informs the Records Office and no record of the course appears on the student’s permanent transcript. Note: students in Translation and/or Interpretation may be required to audit only half of a four (4) credit course as part of their degree program, in which case the audit will be recorded as only two (2) credits.</p>\n<h4 id=\"return-to-table-of-contents\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"/handbook/pages/iv-policies-for-the-institute/a-academic-policies/a-7-policies-concerning-enrollment-and-payment-fees\">Return to table of contents</a><a href=\"#return-to-table-of-contents\" aria-label=\"return to table of contents permalink\" class=\"anchor-link after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"0.75em\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"0.75em\" data-view-component=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link flex-shrink-0 mr-2\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z\"></path></svg></a></h4>","frontmatter":{"title":"A.7.g.
