Plagiarism is passing off another person's work as one's own. It is taking and presenting as one's own the ideas, research, writings, creations, or inventions of another. It makes no difference whether the source is a student or a professional in some field. For example, in written work, whenever as much as a sentence or key phrase is taken from the work of another without specific citation of the source, the issue of plagiarism arises.</p>\n<p>Paraphrasing is the close restatement of another's idea using approximately the language of the original. Paraphrasing without acknowledgment of authorship is also plagiarism and is as serious a violation as an unacknowledged quotation.</p>\n<p>Intentional or unintentional failure to attribute facts that are not common knowledge (whether represented in textual, graphic, statistical, or visual form) also constitutes plagiarism. All writing submitted for formal and informal assessment must be the student’s own work.</p>\n<p><strong>Cheating</strong></p>\n<p>The term “cheating” includes providing, soliciting, or receiving assistance before or during an examination or quiz that is not explicitly authorized by the instructor of record. Copying from a fellow student’s examination or quiz paper, possessing or using unauthorized material during an examinations or quiz (e.g., notes, books, electronic devices) and continuing to write after an exercise has ended all constitute cheating. Inadmissible forms of assistance include allowing a fellow student to copy from an examination or quiz paper, sharing unauthorized materials (e.g. notes, books, electronic devices), and talking or whispering during an examination or quiz. Similarly egregious violations of these standards include, but are not limited to: taking an examination or quiz paper from the room and later claiming that the instructor lost it; changing answers after the examination or quiz has been returned; fraudulent possession of an examination or quiz prior to administration; obtaining a copy of an examination, quiz, or solution key prior to administration; taking an examination or quiz for another student; and persuading another person to take an examination or quiz for oneself.</p>\n<p><strong>Duplicate Use of Written Work</strong></p>\n<p>A paper submitted to meet the requirements of a particular course is assumed to be work completed for that course; the same paper, or substantially similar papers, may not be used to meet the requirements of two different courses, in the same or different terms, without the prior consent of each faculty member involved. Students incorporating similar material in more than one paper are required to confirm each professor's expectations in advance.</p>\n<p><strong>Misconduct in Research</strong></p>\n<p>If there is student research misconduct in the form of fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism, in research sponsored by the federal government, additional procedures and reporting will apply as directed by the Middlebury Misconduct in Research and Other Scholarly Activities Policies and Procedures. Students also have an obligation to report observed, suspected, or apparent research misconduct and to cooperate in the review of inquiries and allegations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"b-student-responsibilities\" style=\"position:relative;\">B.
